Her book project, The Decisive Network: Magnum Photos and the Postwar Image Market, examines the role of photo agencies in shaping postwar visual culture. Based on years of research in over a dozen archives around the world, The Decisive Network looks beyond heroic photographers and their iconic images to demonstrate how a range of professionals brought the aesthetic and production mode of news images into multiple markets for photography. Bair has published articles in the journals History of Photography and American Art, and in the edited volumes Getting the Picture: The Visual Culture of the News and Visualizing Fascism (forthcoming). At Yale’s Digital Humanities Lab, Bair will be mining data from thousands of pages of Magnum business correspondence in order to visualize and analyze the full scope of the agency’s networks. Working on a scale that exceeds the limits of chronological and linear narrative, this project will model new ways to study image saturation and the collaborative labor that yielded it.\n\n        \n      \n        \n          Damon Crockett,\n          Computer Science.\n          Damon Crockett's present work concerns the role of visual evidence in the social sciences. In particular, he considers the ways in which image data can be used to ground substantive explanations in fields like media studies, cultural studies, and digital art history. Damon is developing a set of flexible software tools for the direct visualization of image data.\n\n        \n      \n        \n          Gabor M.

Gabor is working on a digital platform that will enable the exploration of a large-scale collection of interviews of Holocaust survivors.\n\n        \n      \n    \n      2016–2017\n      \n        \n          Jonathan Schroeder,\n          English.\n          Jonathan Schroeder uses the methods of the digital humanist, conceptual historian, and literary scholar to compare how European frameworks of emotion were institutionalized in the Americas. His manuscript, Prisoners of Loss: An Atlantic History of Nostalgia, charts the first phase in the globalization of nostalgia, tracking how this medical concept was carried to the New World and used to design new health care systems for slaves and soldiers in America, Brazil, Cuba, and Haiti. By virtue of this process, he argues, nostalgia was transformed from a disease of travel suffered by European ethnics into the exemplary disease of racial captivity in the nineteenth century, one that can potentially help us make sense of present-day scenes of racial and ethnic melancholy.\n\n        \n      \n        \n          Robin Seguy,\n          Comparative Literature.\n          Robin Seguy uses genetic criticism and close bibliographic techniques to trace the evolution of modern poetic texts.

She received a Ph.D. degree in Italian Language and Literature with a dissertation on medieval vernacular poetry and the mechanical arts.\n\n        \n      \n        \n          Gideon Fink Shapiro,\n          American Studies.\n          Gideon earned a Ph.D. in Architecture (history and theory) from the University of Pennsylvania School of Design, where his dissertation research traced the confluence of garden art and urban planning in the public parks of Paris. His writing has appeared in the Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians, Architect, Domus, the Guggenheim Blog, Next City, and The Architect’s Newspaper, among other publications. He edited the English-language catalogue of the 2015 Urbanism and Architecture Bi-City Biennale (UABB) of Shenzhen and Hong Kong, and has served as an instructor at the undergraduate and graduate levels. Gideon has assisted the curator Aaron Betsky and worked for the architectural design firm of Gabellini Sheppard Associates.

This talk presents two courses as case studies: “Digital Tools for the 21st Century: Sherlock Holmes’s London,” and “Virtually London.” “Digital Tools” uses the Holmes stories as a corpus on which to practice basic digital humanities methodologies and tools, including visualizations, digital archives and editions, GIS, and distant reading, whereas “Virtually London” uses digital archives and narrative maps to study 19th century literature about London, and culminates in creating annotated narrative maps of The Picture of Dorian Gray and The Romance of a Shop.  The talk will present sample assignments and projects from both courses to highlight how digital humanities lets students find new patterns in well-known texts, explore the function of space in literature, and historicize their own technological moment.\n\nTo see slides from the talk, please visit Joanna Swafford’s blog.\n\nWorkshop, 4/6: “Augmented Notes”\nBass Library, L01 at 10:00-11:00am\n\nDo you want to synchronize audio with image?\nHelp non-musicians understand a musical argument?\n\nCome learn how to use Augmented Notes, a public humanities tool that lets users create interactive musical scores, in which measures of a score are highlighted in time with music.

Russian-language poetry from Ukraine seems to be especially suitable for reflecting, investigating, staging or deconstructing the apparent performative contradiction of “Russophone Russophobia.” This staging of performative contradictions will be explored with special reference to the recent work of Odesa poet Boris Khersonskii, who, on his poetic blogs on Facebook and LiveJournal, often ironically stages the performative tension inherent in “Russophobia” expressed in Russian.\n\nThe investigation of Khersonskii’s poetic politics also leads to a methodological conclusion about the application of digital methods to born-digital literary material.

As Hollywood visual effects production began to adopt computational processes, practices, and technologies, what started out as a branch of the IT and computer sciences industry hybridized. Neither ‘inside’ the Hollywood studios traditional financial structures, nor entirely outside the value chains attached to Hollywood’s film output, the VFX industries have functioned as networks of precarious creative industries, offering work for hire on a film by film, contract by contract basis. All of this has led to an industry defined by the migration of labor to an extent that has dwarfed even traditional Hollywood production. In his talk, Leon Gurevitch will consider the effects and migration of precarious labor, as well as the ensuing implications for the future of a Global Hollywood increasingly governed by computational production pipelines. Central to this research are both quantitative and qualitative research approaches that mix interviews with Movie, Games, and Animation professionals (Pixar, Dreamworks, ILM, Weta Digital, Blizzard, Square Enix) with a big data migration visualization tool. The tool details the migration pathways of 80,000 digital image professionals — animators, coders, engineers and artists — across industry and the world over the past 30 years in order to tease out the networked relationships between software, source code, skills migration, and precarious labor in the global VFX industry.\n\nAll are invited to attend!

Their lectures were held in famous meeting halls, taverns, the houses of wealthy patrons, theatres, and churches across the country; Britons inevitably and unknowably walk past sites with a rich history of black activism every day. In this talk, Hannah-Rose will outline some of the benefits digital humanities can give social historians, and how her PhD research - which focuses on African American abolitionists in Britain - has been enriched by digital mapping techniques.\n\nAs an example, Hannah-Rose will discuss her mapping project that highlights abolitionist speaking locations, the main focus of which was to make black American contributions to British society more visible. Recording and visualizing Frederick Douglass’ journey around Britain highlights both his exhausting lecturing schedule, and also the extensive abolitionist network he helped to forge. He travelled to Britain at a time of great industrial change and thus he was able to tap into new transport links that were slowly emerging in Britain. The rapidity of the railway boom was unprecedented and transformed British society: journeys were faster, time was standardized, ship-building increased, trade was made easier and quicker between towns and the countryside. Recognizing this, Douglass argued in Leeds in 1846, that “what is uttered this day in the Music Hall of Leeds, will, within fourteen days resound in Massachusetts.”\n\nBio\nDr. Hannah-Rose Murray received a Ph.D. from the Department of American and Canadian Studies at the University of Nottingham and is a visiting Fellow at the Gilder Lehrman Centre at Yale University. Her research focuses on African American transatlantic visits to Britain between the 1830s and the 1890s. Murray has created a website dedicated to their experiences and has mapped their speaking locations across Britain, showing how black men and women travelled far and wide, from large towns to small fishing villages, to raise awareness of American slavery. Murray’s maps and research can be viewed on her website: Frederick Douglass Map\n\n\n",

Uniting these two aims is the notion of a “keyword,” as Raymond Williams imagined it: a word, often abstract, whose semantic history bears witness to the broader literary, social, and material histories within which it evolved.\n\nNew methods of computational semantics, known variously as “word vectors” or “word embedding models,” allow researchers to trace the changing associations of such keywords across historical corpora, pinpointing moments and directions of semantic change while contextualizing specific trends within broader transformations. This talk, titled “Computational Keywords,” hopes to follow in the tradition of Raymond Williams, Reinhart Koselleck, and other semantic historians, carrying forward the goal and shape of their analyses while altering their scale and methods. Specifically, I investigate which semantic transformations were most active around the turn of the nineteenth century, which both Williams and Koselleck saw as a hinge-period during which a range of social and political concepts acquired their modern meaning. Such an investigation uncovers a particularly striking transformation in ethical and economic abstractions, one through which, it would seem, the independent virtues and vices of an older ethical discourse commensurate into the single, economically-inflected abstraction of “value.”\n\nThis talk is co-sponsored with the 18th/19th-Century Colloquium\n\nBio\nRyan Heuser is a Ph.D. candidate in English at Stanford University, studying British literature and culture in the long eighteenth century.

The figures and geospatial data he will discuss were extracted and processed from indigenous archival material, some of which has never been utilized. Simsek will present his geospatial visualization of the census data and the road network for methodological discussion and feedback from the audience.\n\nThe population surveys carried out between 1829 and 1832 are often regarded as the first “modern” Ottoman census-taking effort. They were aimed at determining the available manpower and tax base for the Ottoman central authority which had initiated an ambitious program of military and administrative expansion and reform. By assessing archival data, Simsek will argue that the Ottoman central authority did not take a new census of its male subjects in 1844 except for in Istanbul, but in fact, it constantly updated its initial registers for the provinces that had been compiled in 1830-1832 through its bureaucratic bodies between 1832 and 1843. The geospatial visualization of the census data from 1829-1832 and 1844 are presented in a comparative fashion to make it much easier to convey an otherwise complicated argument.\n\nFollowing the Turco-Mongolian tradition of rapid and safe movement of information, armies, and merchants through their lands, the Ottoman state was extremely attentive to its road network and the messengers on horseback. A detailed register located in the former private library of Hüsrev Paşa (d. 1855), the long-term commander in chief of the reformed, European-style Ottoman army in 1820s-1830s, shows the distances in hours between post stations and the names of those post stations along the major and minor routes in hours circa 1830. While such “catalogs” are not rare, this document is unusually comprehensive. In this presentation, Simsek will visualize these routes by processing and marking geospatial data of nearly 150 stations. An attempt is also made to demonstrate the distances between postal stations in hours on the map to provide the audience a more accurate sense of geography, distance, and time, which are often missing in conventional studies on the Ottoman history.\n\nBio\nVeysel Simsek is a postdoctoral associate in International Security Studies at Yale University.\n\n\n\n",

Basu will ask how we might understand such distinctiveness within a regime of early modern spelling that already tolerated a wide degree of variation.\n\nWhile the EEBO-TCP corpus provides unprecedented access to the early English print record, its orthographic irregularity has often been seen as little more than an annoyance – a hindrance for computational analysis. However, Basu will argue that the ability to perform stylometric analysis based on orthographic variation within this vast corpus not only allows us to trace the broad patterns of orthographic evolution over the first two centuries of English print, but also enables meticulously historicized literary profiling. Spenser’s general orthographic practice, Basu will contend, conforms to the broad expectations of Spenser’s period.\n\nAll Yale students, faculty, and staff are invited to attend.

HTRC supports text and data mining projects using HathiTrust’s digital library, which includes 17.3 million items.\n\nSpread over four days, each workshop will address a different aspect of text and data mining using HathiTrust data and HTRC services.\nAttendees are not required to attend all four workshops, and can pick and choose the events that best match their interests and schedules. If you are new to text mining and HathiTrust, it is recommended that you start with the introductory session.\n\nLibrarians who attend all four workshops will be invited to join a cohort of other librarians who are teaching with and about the HTRC. This cohort has access to additional support from HTRC, further training opportunities, and a community of peers who are interested in HTRC.\n\nIndividual Workshops\n\n“Introduction to HTRC for Text and Data Mining,” Oct. 6\n\nIn this session, we will explore the basics of HathiTrust as a data source and demo how to utilize HTRC as a resource for text and data mining. The workshop will address the various tools and services of the HTRC, along with options for accessing data from HathiTrust for text mining research. The session will be helpful for those who want a general overview, or who want a solid foundation for the other workshops in the series.\n\nPrerequisites: None.\n\n“HTRC Extracted Features Dataset,” Oct. 7\n\nThis session will introduce you to the Extracted Features data model and the kinds of research it enables. HTRC recently released an updated version of the Extracted Features dataset (v.2.0) that includes 17+ million files, with each file representing a volume in the HathiTrust Digital Library. The Extracted Features files contain metadata about the volumes, as well as tokens (words), parts of speech, and their per-page counts. The dataset can be used for text analysis projects where access to the words and word-counts in a volume are expected by the algorithm, such as topic modeling or certain kinds of machine learning projects. This session will include a hands-on activity using the dataset.\n\nPrerequisites: either the “Introduction to HTRC for text and data mining” workshop, or some previous experience with HathiTrust or HTRC.\n\n“HTRC Data Capsules Environment,” Oct. 8\n\nThis session will introduce you to the HTRC’s capsule environment and how it can be used by intermediate and advanced researchers. An HTRC Data Capsule is a virtual machine with special security settings that allows researchers to access text data from HathiTrust, analyze it using the text and data mining methods of their choice, and then export only the results of their analysis. This session will include a hands-on activity using an HTRC Data Capsule.\n\nPrerequisites: either the “Introduction to HTRC for text and data mining” workshop, or some previous experience with HathiTrust or HTRC.\n\n“Supporting Text and Data Mining from the Library,” Oct. 9\n\nThis librarian-only workshop will feature a presentation and discussion of the skills, practices, and challenges of supporting text and data mining as a librarian. It will explore the rapidly-changing landscape for digital humanities and digital scholarship, and how librarians can best situate themselves to address the shifting needs of researchers.\n\nPrerequisites: None. Librarians who complete this workshop in addition to the previous 3 will be invited to join a cohort of trainers who have gone through an HTRC workshop and have access to additional support for teaching with and about the HTRC.\n\nRegistration &amp; Logistics\n\nThe workshop series is open to all Yale faculty, graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, librarians, and academic staff. To sign up, please fill out this brief registration form.\n\nEach workshop will be held via Zoom and will include a mix of presentation, discussion, and hands-on components. We will use breakout rooms to support hands-on activities. You will not be required to install any software to participate in the workshops.\n\nFor questions, please reach out to the Yale Digital Humanities Lab, which is serving as a co-host for this workshop series, alongside the University of Maryland.\n",

One of the most enigmatic elements of their supposed timekeeping were star clocks, lists of stars and constellations – called decans – which marked the passing of the hours of the night. The decans performed mysterious actions during the night, which the most prolific work in Egyptian Astronomy equates with heliacally rising (rising at sunset). This theory is not without tension, however, and leaves the vast majority of the decans unidentified.\n\nAs a Fellow of Yale’s Franke Program in the Humanities and Natural sciences, I have been working on comparing these lists and tables to a reproduction of the Ancient Egyptian sky at different dates. My aim it to create a correlation of the Egyptian sky with the Greek names we use today, thus creating a diagram of the Egyptian heavens. I have begun creating my Python own code for this purpose, called Decan-O.py, which relies on the core python package AstroPy.\n\nDecan-O.py takes in a named star and returns its coordinates in the night sky for a given year BCE, and then uses that information to generate plots of the star’s altitude and location on the horizon over the year — information that I hope to use to constrain the actions of the Egyptian decans.\n\nFurthermore, I am experimenting with using the raw data to create custom star charts in ArcGIS Story Maps, thereby getting a different view of the data and a better visualization of the so-called “decanal belt”. My hope is that this can serve to recreate the experience of stargazing in Ancient Egypt as an experimental archaeology practice even a little bit, particularly while planetariums remain closed and travel is risky due to COVID.\n\nThis presentation will take place at the 2021 Connecticut Digital Humanities virtual conference.

For a digital humanities project, this often entails either finding a collection of texts or images online or digitizing physical holdings.\n\nTools for cleaning and processing texts\n\nYou have a digitized corpus, now what? The answer to this depends on what your data looks like and what your research questions are. For a few possibilities:\n\n  For most typescript material, you could run it through optical character recognition (OCR) software. OCRing texts turns them from images into searchable, machine-actionable texts. One of the leading tools in this area is ABBYY FineReader. While not free software, ABBYY is available on two of the computers in the Digital Humanities Lab. Depending on the quality of the scan and the type of document you’re working with, some hand cleaning post OCRing may be necessary (for example, ‘l’ may be misidentified as ‘1’).\n  For handwritten material, humans are still the best transcribers. Depending on the size and content of your corpus, crowdsourcing could be an option.\n  For messy tabular data, you could use OpenRefine, a free tool for cleaning and transforming textual data.\n\n\nHow can the DHLab help?\n\nDigital Humanities Lab staff can advise on strategies for building and cleaning your corpus during our weekly Office Hours. We also regularly offer workshops that are relevant to corpus creation. Visit our Workshops page to learn about what’s coming up and our GitHub page for tutorials from past sessions. For information on the use of our scanners for corpus creation, as well as information on databases that are already available for text and data mining, please visit our Data Resources page.\n",

      "content": "Identify your Audience and Venue\n\nUser-centered experiences meet users where they’re at so it’s helpful to identify your key audiences and the contexts in which your work will reach them. Dissemination means considering how it will be seen, shared, and distributed, whether you’re interested in publishing in a print journal, presenting a conference poster, developing a mobile app, or creating a website.\n\nKeep in mind that different venues will have different presentation affordances — a website, for instance, can support using color and interaction to display your data in ways that a print journal, which might be published only in black and white, cannot.\n\nDefine your Deliverables\n\nThinking about how you will disseminate your project early on can help you to articulate clearly the desired deliverables for the project. Here are some of popular types of digital humanities deliverables:\n\nData Visualization – A data-driven visual expression that offers macro views of patterns for large datasets, as well as micro views for individual data points.\n\nInteractive Infographic - A more narrative form of digital storytelling that curates data into multimedia interactions.\n\nSoftware - Creating a tool that users can process data with, whether it’s for a pre-defined collection or their own materials.\n\nOnline Exhibition or Digital Tour - A project website that leverages multimedia interfaces to enrich visual or spatial analysis of data collections.\n\nThese are just some of the many ways digital humanities projects might take shape.\n\nPresentation Platforms\n\nFor free platforms that don’t require separate web hosting and that are particulaly well-suited to displaying a range of media types, try:\n\n  Story Maps\n  Scalar\n  Omeka\n\n\nFind Web Hosting\n\nThe following resources provide great web hosting services for projects you do want to host yourself:\n\nReclaim Hosting was specially designed with students, educators, and institutions in mind. It provides a more affordable service for web hosting.\n\nGitHub Pages is a service that allows users to host web applications free of charge on GitHub’s servers. There’s a catch though: your site will be run from a static-file server, meaning you can’t run any server-side code with GitHub hosting. If you don’t know whether your application requires a server, stop by the Digital Humanities Lab and we can help you determine.\n\nHeroku is a beginner-friendly server provider that lets users run up to three web applications with custom server-side code for free. It’s a great first step into digital web hosting if you are working on an application with server-side code.\n\nAmazon Web Services’ (AWS) EC2 Instances allow users to host web applications that run custom server-side code. Students get 1 free year of EC2 instances but afterwards  must pay to use Amazon servers. AWS is harder to use than Heroku and requires familiarity with server administration. That said, AWS is quickly becoming the industry standard for scalable web hosting.\n\nMicrosoft Azure is Microsoft’s version of AWS. If you like Windows and Microsoft products, you may find Azure easier to work with (though AWS supports Windows as well).\n\nConsider Data Storage Providers\n\nIf you have lots of data to store, you may want to look into cloud storage providers, such as the following:\n\nGitHub allows users to host tens of thousands of files with up to 1GB of disk space for free in each user repository. For small projects this may be sufficient.\n\nDropbox provides simple, easy to use digital storage. You can store several gigabytes for free, but if you need to store lots of content you’ll need to pay a montly fee for storage.\n\nAmazon Web Services’ S3 allows users to upload arbitrarily large data collections. Students get 1 free year of hosting but must pay thereafter. AWS features a geat “command line interface” with which users can upload and download content from the command line.\n\nConnecting with your Audiences\n\nOnce you have identified the platform for sharing your work, be sure to use it in a way that is user-friendly and accessible.\n\nUser-Testing - It’s always a good idea to test your assumptions on real users as you design your project. The Digital Humanities Lab can provide advice and support for conducting user testing and research.\n\nAccessibility - There are many resources for ensuring that your project is built in a way that is accessible to a broad range of users. You can refer to the Accessibility Guidelines provided by Yale ITS on their best practices for testing and evaluation. For additional recommendations, we encourage reviewing the latest Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).\n",

Prioritizing time early on to become familiar with your dataset helps to clarify the project’s viability, scope, and constraints.\n\n\n  \n    Project Planning &amp; Design Guide – This step-by-step guide for Rapid Prototyping Grant projects provides an overview of how a project might move from big ideas to product implementation and user testing. While not all projects are built the same way, this can help project leaders better understand how to manage resources and expectations to meet their goals within a given timeline.\n  \n  \n    Lean Canvas – This exercise focuses on establishing the project vision by identifying the overarching research question(s), audiences, and methods.\n  \n  \n    User Analysis – This will walk you through user experience exercises for defining user stories and mapping out the scenarios of user engagement with your project.\n  \n  \n    Ideation – These worksheets are designed to translate your user scenarios into a series of sketches that will lay the foundation for the \"minimum viable product\" (MVP), the minimal set of functionality that completes the project's fundamental requirements. These sketches can be very useful when collaborating with designers and developers. Ideation sets the stage for more user-centered design collaboration that might include wireframe mockups of the MVP.\n  \n  \n    Project Charter – The MVP is a distillation of big ideas into a focused set of production goals and deliverables. It serves as the basis of the Project Charter, a signed agreement that articulates the production workflow, roles and responsibilities of collaborators, project timeline, and allocation of resources. Signing the Project Charter marks the transition from the planning phase to the implementation phase.\n  \n  \n    Project Closeout – The production process includes workflows for design, content, coding, and analysis, culminating in a protoype. User testing is one way to assess the prototype's usability. Following final adjustments to the interface, a Project Closeout meeting is an opportunity for all stakeholders to review lessons learned and to articulate the maintenance and long-term sustainability of the project.\n  \n\nDownload Toolkit\n\nFor support with project planning and design, please stop by the Digital Humanities Lab during Office Hours to ask questions or try an exercise.\n\nIdentifying Your Project Timeline\n\nCollaborators on a digital humanities project should have a shared, manageable timeline within which to complete the work. It’s therefore helpful to sketch out your major project milestones, along with the dates by which you need to achieve those milestones.\n\nIf you’re working toward a conference presentation, are on a grant cycle, or otherwise have a date by which you need to wrap up all project work, try working backwards with your timeline to determine whether your full project vision can be achieved in your available time. List all of your project goals along with conservative estimations of the time required for each — build in some time for project iteration, back-up plans, and other time commitments you have that might affect your availability for this project. If you need help estimating timelines or identifying your project’s core milestones, stop by the DHLab so we can discuss your project together!\n\nFinding On-Campus Collaborators\n\nMany digital humanities projects emerge from cross-discplinary conversations. When starting a project, reach out to people from other fields who have different research interests and skillsets to see if they might be open to collaborating. To identify potential partners on campus, try emailing departmental listservs with open project calls. You can also reach out to the DHLab to see if we know of someone who might be a good match.\n",

Check out a few exciting DH-related courses below!\n\nIf you are teaching a course connected to DH and would like it included, please email the DHLab.\n\n\n  **The American Counterculture, ENGL 195**\n  Mondays, Wednesdays 1:30-2:20pm\n  R. John Williams\n\n\nThis lecture offers an introduction to the notion of the “counterculture” as both a historical and literary phenomenon.  We will not only introduce basic definitions of the concept (as understood by participants in the 1960s and 1970s), but also complicate those same definitions, offering more nuanced explorations of what it meant to cultivate an experience that ran “counter” to the dominant practices of American bourgeois society. DH Fellow Kimberly Quiogue Andrews will assist with this course.\n\n\n  **Avant-Gardes and Émigrés, RUS 384/690**\n  Tuesdays, Thursdays 11:35am-12:50pm\n  Marijeta Bozovic\n\n\nThe Avant-Gardes and Émigrés Lab, a highly collaborative experimental seminar open to graduate students and advanced undergraduates, has two primary objectives: to familiarize students with the work of some of the most influential Russian artists, writers, and thinkers of the twentieth century; and to introduce students to new ways of conducting and presenting research, using digital tools. DH Fellow Carlotta Chenoweth will assist with this course.\n\n\n  **Computational Tools for Data Science, CPSC 262/STAT 262**\n  Tuesdays, Thursdays 2:30-3:45pm\n  Daniel Spielman\n\n\nThis course provides an introduction to the core ideas and principles that arise in modern data analysis, bridging statistics and computer science and providing students the tools to grow and adapt as methods and techniques change. Topics include principle component analysis, independent component analysis, dictionary learning, neural networks, clustering, streaming algorithms (streaming linear algebra techniques), online learning, large scale optimization, simple database manipulation, and implementations of systems on distributed computing infrastructures. Students require background in linear algebra, multivariable calculus, and programming.\n\nTake after or concurrently with MATH 222, 225, or 231, after or concurrently with MATH 120, 230, or ENAS 151, after or concurrently with CPSC 100, 112, or ENAS 130\n\n\n  **Gender &amp; Sexuality in Media and Popular Culture, AMST 402/ANTHRO 302/FILM 324/WGSS 380**\n  Tuesdays 2:30-4:20pm\n  T.L. Cowan, Laura Wexler\n\n\nAs part of the FemTechNet DOCC, this seminar on popular culture in the United States and transnationally will teach digital skills via a significant lab component in which students use media technologies to make and illustrate arguments. In the course, we will discuss gender, race, class, and sexuality in relation to the production, circulation, consumption, and reception of media culture.\n\n\n  **Introduction to Latin American History, HIST 325**\n  Mondays, Wednesdays 10:30-11:20am\n  Anne Eller\n\n\nThis lecture class offers an introduction to critical themes and events across a broad swath of Latin America’s history. The course considers major formative epochs and themes of race, class, and gender through the exploration of case studies from across the Central and South America and the Caribbean.  In order to engage meaningfully with these themes, the approach of the course is two-fold.  First, lectures offer a broad sweep of events, zooming in on moments of particular interest in ample context.  The readings, discussion section, and digital humanities elements, meanwhile, focus much more closely on individual countries, events, and groups. DH Fellow Brandi Waters will assist with this course.\n\n\n  **Quantitative Linguistics using Corpora, LING 234/634**\n  Wednesdays 4:00-5:50pm\n  Kevin Tang\n\n\nThis course provides an introduction to the basics of corpus linguistics. Students will learn how to compile and process corpora, as well as how to conduct statistical tests in R in order to better understand linguistic patterns. We will both create new corpora (through Webmining using BootCat) and use existing sets (e.g. COCA, British National Corpus) to discuss how extracted norms can be used to predict behavioral data.

The initiative will foreground the continuity of Russian Formalism, structuralism, semiotics, and discourse analysis with emerging work in Digital Humanities today. By studying social and institutional networks, the team will explore the dissemination and evolution of interpretive practices. The intersection of two fields uniquely situates us to interrogate the foundations of Digital Humanities practices, even as we explore new research methods, pedagogical tools, and archival and resource-sharing possibilities for cultural studies of Russia and East Europe.\n\nTelling History through Images: New Tools for Visually Driven Narratives\n\nPrincipal Investigators: Fabian Drixler and Peter Perdue\n\nThe Visualizing Cultures website, dedicated to the examination of interactions between modern Asia and the West, contains over 50 units that exemplify a new form of historical analysis that integrates images and text in the form of visually drive narrative. This project will extend and redesign the existing website so as to expand the opportunities for other scholars to contribute to this emerging genre by developing software tools for the existing corpus or by creating templates that will allow scholars to work with their own images.\n\nJohn Ashbery’s ‘Nest’: A Virtual Tour and Digital Study Center of a Poet and Collector in his Hudson House\n\nPrincipal Investigator: Karin Roffman\n\nProject Team: Ninoslav Adzibaba (VHR Solutions), Milan Branezac (VHR Solutions), Monica Ong Reed (DHLab)\n\nThis project will provide ​crucial documentation of the American poet John Ashbery’s Victorian house and collections. Using new virtual reality technologies to explore inside the house, we will create a prototype of the center hall that includes photographs, archival records, and audio clips of Ashbery and others discussing his collections. The website we design will enable users to experience the intimacy of being in “the middle of things,” a reality that echoes in Ashbery’s poems.\n\nA Digital, Mobile, and Interactive Field Guide to New Haven’s Built Heritage\n\nPrincipal Investigator: Elihu Rubin\n\nThe New Haven Building Archive (NHBA) brings together ten years of student research on buildings and streetscapes in New Haven, Connecticut. As an interactive digital guide to local buildings and the role they play in the life of the city, the NHBA will harness digital mapping technologies, place-based storytelling, and community-based research to prompt conversations about the historical patterns and future development of New Haven.\n\nThe Economy of Information in Renaissance Florence\n\nPrincipal Investigator: Francesca Trivellato\n\nProject Team: Pauline Bernard, Priscilla Coker, Russell Gasdia, Matteo Giuli, Stewart Palmer, Carlo Taviani, Niccolò Valmori\n\nWas Renaissance Florence the cradle of Western capitalism and individualism? This project will create an online platform that will allow users to draw from unpublished archival material to search for new answers to this age-old question. Thanks to the Project Grant, the team will develop the analytics and visualization component of a relational database based on nearly 5,000 limited partnerships registered in Florence between 1445 and 1808 — arguably the longest and most homogeneous archival series of business contracts from pre-industrial Europe.\n",

      "content": "The Digital Humanities Lab is pleased to announce the recipients of our 2017 Project Grants. These awards support both the initial planning phases and also the continued development of Yale faculty projects that pursue innovation and excellence in the humanities by way of digital methods.\n\nProject Descriptions\n\nInternet Cultures: Histories, Networks, Practice\n\nMarijeta Bozovic, Assistant Professor of Slavic Languages and Literatures; Film and Media Studies; Women’s, Gender, and Sexuality Studies\n\nMarta Figlerowicz, Assistant Professor of Comparative Literature; English; Film and Media Studies\n\nInternet cultures have transformed our world in the past quarter of a century, as human beings seemingly overnight learned to use and depend on computer networks for various kinds of work, military operations, pursuits of scientific knowledge, religious proselytizing, political organization, searches for mates and social communities, information retrieval, e-commerce, illegal activities, and infinite varieties of play. The very size of this “cultural production” defies understanding, and for a long time it has also defied systematic study. The prominence of the Internet in our everyday experience needs to be more fully recognized in the undergraduate humanities curriculum. With the Project Grant we received, we will design a research, teaching, and learning initiative that aims to establish Internet studies within Yale’s undergraduate humanities curriculum, and to give such studies a prominent place within our university’s outreach programs. We plan 1) to create a shareable undergraduate syllabus and lecture course across several departments and programs on the diverse histories, technologies, and cultural practices of the Internet, and 2) to develop outreach and resource-sharing practices in the humanities with public high schools in New Haven, Connecticut.\n\nThe Digital Archive of Medieval Song\n\nArdis Butterfield, John M. Schiff Professor of English &amp; Director of Graduate Studies; Professor of French and Music\n\nThe Digital Archive of Medieval Song will bring together in a uniquely comprehensive way the texts, manuscript images, music, and scholarly resources relating to medieval song in England. At the center of this largely undiscovered field are the approximately 2,000 medieval lyrics catalogued by modern editors. These poems survive in around 450 manuscripts from the twelfth to the early sixteenth centuries; only a fraction has yet been published in any form. The challenges of working with this material include its diversity, quantity, anonymity, trilingual character, and the difficulty involved in recovering the music so integral to the poems’ medieval existence as song. This project will create a prototype website using a limited corpus of lyrics, presenting an archive of medieval English songs in the richness of their manuscript and musical contexts. Its image-viewing platform will link manuscript image with lyric text, musical notation, sound recording and scholarly commentary. The platform and its search interface will enable new research into medieval song, and bring this rich heritage within reach of the general public.\n\nLiving Desegregation: A Digital Gamification of Decision-Making and Consequence in the Jim Crow South\n\nMatthew Jacobson, William Robertson Coe Professor of American Studies and History; Ethnicity, Race &amp; Migration Director; Public Humanities at Yale acting Co-Director\n\nLiving Desegregation is a digital “gamification” of US social history, focusing on the lived experience of African Americans in the Jim Crow south during the hopeful but dangerous era of desegregation (1954-1970). Designed for students from eighth grade through college, the platform is part of a web-based educational package accompanying the NEH-funded documentary film * A Long Way from Home: The Untold Story of Baseball’s Desegregation * (anticipated release 2017). The gamification is based on a decision-tree design, confronting students with myriad social decisions both large and minute (Do I go into this restaurant, or do I wait on the bus? Do I try to rent in this neighborhood? Do I challenge this teammate for his racist comment?), with each decision resulting in a documented consequence and linking to both archival materials and interview clips from the documentary film. While most of today’s students easily recognize the injustice of past White/Colored codes of social conduct, few have a realistic sense of the ins and outs, the nuances, the contradictions, the inconsistencies and caprices, the local or regional variations, and the ubiquitous dangers of Jim Crow custom. The “game” embeds a serious and needed historical pedagogy.\n\nThe Tekagami-jō Project\n\nEdward Kamens, Sumitomo Professor of Japanese Studies\n\nThe Tekagami-jō, currently housed in the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library, is a 17th-century album of Japanese calligraphy samples in a variety of styles that are attributed to distinguished writers—emperors, ministers, clerics, poets and the like. The samples include poems and excerpts from literary works, letters, documents, and other miscellaneous writings dateable to as early as the 8th century. It has been recognized by specialists as one of the very finest extant examples of such albums, comparable to a similar album recently acquired by the Metropolitan Museum of Art and to the best-known examples in Japanese collections. This project aims to create a comprehensive bilingual web-based presentation and analysis of the entire contents using the Vercelli engine or a similar platform supported by the Digital Humanities Lab, which will include high-resolution images, transcriptions, translations, and short essays on the attributed calligraphers, the literary or documentary content of each sample, and the culture of calligraphy albums as such.\n\nOut of the Desert Digital Portal\n\nMary Ting Yi Lui, Professor of American Studies and History; Head of College for Timothy Dwight College\n\nWith the Project Grant, Out of the Desert will overhaul the architecture of our current website outofthedesert.yale.edu, implementing a web application that will serve as a standalone digital portal for exploring the history of the World War II incarceration of Japanese Americans. Organized around key humanities themes, the site will provide a scholarly, engaging introduction to the public through the use of interactive, user-driven modules. Through a partnership with Brown University’s Choices Program, we will also develop a “blended learning” environment, using the web application as a platform for pedagogical instruction outside of the classroom. Digital tools will also extend the range of possibilities for scholarly research. This includes tethering extant excel databases of incarcerees to visualization tools, allowing scholars to engage with “big data” demographic trends. We will also geotag extant digitized material from Yale and the Library of Congress and overlay this content on a revised interactive map.\n\nThe Digital Fauvel\n\nAnna Zayaruznaya, Assistant Professor in the Department of Music\n\nThe Digital Fauvel is an interactive facsimile-edition of the Roman de Fauvel as preserved in the manuscript Paris, Bibliothèque Nationale fr. 146. It will enable a variety of user interactions with the manuscript including viewing and navigating high-resolution scans, viewing superimposed translations of the text, searching manuscript text and metadata, viewing modern editions of musical items, and listening to musical audio. By bringing together information traditionally available in disparate places (editions, facsimiles, translations, commentary), we create new ways for students, scholars, and the public to interact with this important source. A prototype was designed in 2012–2013 for the now-obsolete Samsung SUR40. In the current phase, The Digital Fauvel will be built to run on the Web as well as a large multi-touch tabletop, with an earlier version of the text programmed in for comparison. New interfaces for interacting with musical content will also be implemented.\n",

We ask, for example, how do poetry, fiction, and the visual arts recruit and account for perceptual experience or consider material and natural objects? What happens when the empirical psychology of consciousness or the categories of the sublime, beautiful, and picturesque take narrative or poetic form? What sort of ethical models follow from formal or generic decisions? We focus throughout on how these topics have been discussed across the history of literary studies, and we pay close attention to current debates in the field, including those prompted by new formalisms and materialisms, critical race studies, cognitive literary studies, and the digital humanities.

      "content": "The Digital Editing and the Medieval Manuscript Roll (DEMMR) project had a busy spring semester, collaborating with Emory University and the University of Pennsylvania to hold two workshops. At both events, participants learned the basics of the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) and markup languages, considered the complexities of digital editing, and tackled the challenges of medieval manuscript rolls as a form.\n\nThe Emory workshop focused upon a genealogical roll that is nearly 22 feet long. The roll, which was donated by an anonymous benefactor, contains a genealogy of English kings and features early modern continuations that were sewn on after the roll’s production. The roll will join several other genealogies in a growing collection of editions, including Takamiya MS 35. The workshop welcomed fourteen participants from various institutions. It was organized by Jenny Bledsoe and taught by James Eric Ensley, Elizabeth Hebbard, Gina M. Hurley, and Annie Killian.\n\nThe University of Pennsylvania workshop, which welcomed nine graduate students and librarians, focused on a devotional roll containing Middle English and Latin prayers. Upon its completion, the edition will be one of several in the digital collection focused upon devotional materials, including the Beinecke Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library Osborn a14. Ensley and Hurley traveled to Philadelphia to lead this course, which was organized by Aylin Malcolm and Judith Weston. University of Pennsylvania PhD students Matt Aiello, Nathalie Lacarrière, and Mariah Min also taught several sessions of the workshop.\n\nThese events were followed by a one-day workshop at Indiana University, led by James Eric Ensley and Elizabeth Hebbard, and our first ever Advanced Workshop, led by Dana Kovarik Key, Calum Cockburn, Agata Zielinksa and Lauren Rozenberg at University College London.\n\nAll of these events, which have been offered free of charge to participants, are part of a larger series of digital editing workshops. So far, well over one hundred graduate students have taken the course, which has been held at Yale University, University College London, the University of Toronto, Columbia University, Emory University, and the University of Pennsylvania. The collaborative editions produced will be gathered in a single database: Rolls and Scrolls after the Codex: English Manuscript Rolls 1200-1600.\n\nIn early April, Ensley and Hurley unveiled a beta version of the project’s Edition Visualization Technology (EVT), based upon The Digital Vercelli Book, at the Yale Digital Humanities Lab’s third annual Beyond Boundaries: A Symposium of Hybrid Scholarship at Yale.. Additional presentations took place at the International Medieval Congress in Kalamazoo, MI, where Hurley and Joe Stadolnik gave talks about the project. Additionally, two panels, sponsored by the program, gathered colleagues and former workshop participants to discuss the peculiarities of manuscript rolls and fragments.\n\nTo learn more, please visit the project website. You can also contact the current director of the program, James Eric Ensley.\n\nDEMMR is made possible by the continued support of the Yale Digital Humanities Laboratory, the Beinecke Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library, and the Medieval Academy of America, as well as by the generosity of collaborating institutions.\n\n\nLiz Hebbard (Indiana University) and Lisa Fagin Davis (Medieval Academy of America) examine our 22-foot-long genealogical roll.\n\n\nThe winners of the first encoding exercise in XML: Tina Montenegro, Nicole Corrigan, Mary Grace DuPree, Yoel Castillo Botello (from left to right).

See below for a list of classes related to the digital humanities.\n\nIf you are teaching a course connected to DH and would like it included, please email the Digital Humanities Lab.\n\nAdvanced Web Application Development in the Digital Humanities\nCPSC 376 \nBenedict Brown\n\nAdvanced applications of computer and data science in the humanities, including web technologies, visualization, and database design. Students work in teams to develop a variety of applications proposed by faculty and staff from the Digital Humanities Lab, the Institute for the Preservation of Cultural Heritage, and the Computer Science department. Meets with CPSC 376. Students may earn credit for CPSC 276 or 376; not both.\n\nPrerequisite: CPSC 223 or equivalent, or permission of the instructor.\n\nAnthropology of Information\nANTH 570\nPaul Kockelman\n\nThis course is about the digital and computational mediation of meaning. In some sense, it is about human-based significance in relation to machine-based sieving. We read classic works in media studies, cybernetics, computer science, semiotics, anthropology, and critical theory. Key topics include the relation between meaning and information; the relation between interpretation and computation; and the relation between interaction and infrastructure.\n\nArchives: Histories, Practices, Theories, and Formations\nAMST 853, FILM 806, WGSS 853\nLaura Wexler\n\nThis seminar studies the co-constitution of objects-with-documents and undocumented people. We explore theoretical, historical, material, practical, methodological, and curatorial questions related to the operation and status of the archive in this migration of objects and people. Students are asked to work collaboratively in and with archives as sources and tools, and to experiment with creating archives of their own. The seminar involves some travel to Brown and some irregular hours that are mentioned in the syllabus.\n\nDigital China: Using Computational Methods to Illuminate Society, Politics, Culture, and History\nANTH 405, EAST 403, SOCY 309\nCharles Chang\n\n  move to Spring 2019 semester\n\n\nIn the humanities and social sciences, those who study China face a vast volume of disparate information that ranges from historical archives and maps to the news and social media posts of our time. Such abundance and variety of data can seem daunting, quite beyond an individual’s capacity to digest, and yet, with appropriate concepts and methods, the data can be accessed and sorted out in such a way as to allow the researcher to address questions, hitherto neglected or insufficiently analyzed, in Chinese history, politics, society, and culture. The course has two components: seminar and workshop. In the seminar, we discuss the ideas and concepts behind the collection of data, which could be temporal, spatial, or textual; this is followed by an introduction to network analysis and visualization. In the workshop, students gain hands-on experience in the full actualization of a project. Note that although the course’s title is “Digital China,” its ideas and methods are applicable to other non-Western countries. Students whose research interest lies in, Southeast Asia, Central Asia, or Africa are welcome.\n\nIntroduction to Computing and Programming\nCPSC 100\nBenedict Brown\n\nIntroduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and to the art of programming. Students learn how to think algorithmically and solve problems efficiently. Topics include abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, software engineering, and web development. Languages include C, Python, SQL, and JavaScript, plus CSS and HTML. Problem sets inspired by real-world domains of biology, cryptography, finance, forensics, and gaming. See CS50’s website, https://cs50.yale.edu, for additional information.\n\nNo previous programming experience required. Open to students of all levels and majors.\n\nIntroduction to Web Application for the Digital Humanities\nCPSC 276\nBenedict Brown\nDH Teaching Fellow, Yoni Nadiv\n\nIntroduction to applications of computer and data science in the humanities, including web technologies, visualization, and database design. Students work in teams to develop a variety of applications proposed by faculty and staff from the Digital Humanities Lab, the Institute for the Preservation of Cultural Heritage, and the Computer Science department. Meets with CPSC 376. Students may earn credit for CPSC 276 or 376; not both. Humanities graduate students with an interest in digital humanities are heartily welcomed in this class with permission of their DGS.\n\nPrerequisite: CPSC 110, CPSC 112, equivalent programming experience, or permission of the instructor.\nLiterary Theory\nCPLT 881, ENGL 960, WGSS 960\nMarta Figlerowicz and Jonathan Kramnick\n\nWhat is literary theory today, and what is its history? The aim of the course is to introduce students to central concepts in theory and explore their relation to method. We examine the variety of approaches available within the field of literary studies, including older ones such as Russian formalism, New Criticism, deconstruction, Marxism, and psychoanalysis, as well as newer ones like actor-network theory and digital humanities research. We explore the basic tenets and histories of these theories in a way that is both critical and open-minded, and discuss their comparative advantages and pitfalls. The focus is on recurrent paradigms, arguments, and topics, and on transhistorical relations among our various schools of literary-theoretical thought. Readings might include work by René Wellek, Paul de Man, Jacques Derrida, Gayatri Spivak, Bruno Latour, Judith Butler, Northrop Frye, Fred Moten, and many others.\n\nLiterature and the Future, 1887 to the Present\nENGL 287\nR. John Williams\nDH Teaching Fellow, Tyler Lutz\n\nA survey of literature’s role in anticipating and constructing potential futures since 1887. Early Anglo-American and European futurism during the years leading up to World War I; futures of speculative fiction during the Cold War; futuristic dreams of contemporary cyberpunk. What literature can reveal about the human need to understand both what is coming and how to respond to it.\n\nLiterature Seminars: Good Literature\nENGL 115\nRyan Wepler\nDH Teaching Fellow, Elizabeth Krontiris\n\nExploration of major themes in selected works of literature. Individual sections focus on topics such as war, justice, childhood, sex and gender, the supernatural, and the natural world. Emphasis on the development of writing skills and the analysis of fiction, poetry, drama, and nonfiction prose.\n",

Course work includes field trips and digital projects as well as readings in the scholarship of public memory, cultural heritage, conservation, and aesthetics.\n\nData and Information Visualization\nCPSC 446, CPSC 546\nHolly Rushmeier\n\nVisualization is a powerful tool for understanding data and concepts. This course provides an introduction to the concepts needed to build new visualization systems, rather than to use existing visualization software. Major topics are abstracting visualization tasks, using visual channels, spatial arrangements of data, navigation in visualization systems, using multiple views, and filtering and aggregating data. Case studies to be considered include a wide range of visualization types and applications in humanities, engineering, science, and social science.\n\nPrerequisite: CPSC 223.\n\nData Science for Politics and Policy\nEVST 454, PLSC 454\nFredrik Sävje\n\nData plays an increasingly important role in policy making and politics. The ability to draw valid conclusions from quantitative information can tilt elections or be the difference between a successful or failed policy. This course teaches how to use tools from statistics, data science, and machine learning to solve problems and challenges faced in policy making and politics. Students learn how data can help people make campaign decisions, detect election fraud, predict election outcomes, and investigate if a policy had the intended effect. Students receive an introduction to statistical programming in R, supervised and unsupervised machine learning, and causal inference.\n\nDigital Anthropology\nANTH 411\nEve Zucker\n\nDigital Anthropology is an emerging field of anthropology that explores the ways in which digital mediums such as internet platforms are shaping and being shaped by human experience. This advanced seminar course is designed to be a collaborative exploration of the ways in which digital mediums, practices, and technologies have become part of the human experience. The seminar approaches the topic from an anthropological perspective drawing on relevant ethnographies as well as cross-disciplinary texts and media to explore this emergent topic.\n\nDigital China: Using Computational Methods to Illuminate Society, Politics, Culture, and History\nANTH 405, EAST 403, SOCY 309\nCharles Chang\n\nIn the humanities and social sciences, those who study China face a vast volume of disparate information that ranges from historical archives and maps to the news and social media posts of our time.

Applied techniques for the acquisition, creation, storage, management, visualization, animation, transformation, analysis, and synthesis of cartographic data in digital form.\n\nIntellectual Property in the Digital Age\nCPSC 184\nXiyin Tang\n\nThe evolving and oftentimes vexing intellectual property regime of the new digital age. Focus on copyright, fair use, remix culture, access to knowledge, technological innovations, the increasing relevance of trademarks in the new information society, the tension between creativity/creating and the intellectual property rules which either foster or inhibit it, and the new information culture of the digital age.\n\nPrerequisite: CPSC 183 or permission of instructor.\n\nPrinting Wars\nFREN 868\nChristophe Schuwey\n\nSeventeenth-century France brought about a new relationship to writing, information, and media that transformed the style and the purpose of literature. In this course we explore various kinds of disputes in which writing and printing played a part. We examine literary quarrels and the way they created success and stars; delve into questions about propaganda, early modern fake news, and innovative strategies the government developed to control public opinion; and explore competition between the printed book and digital humanities, thinking about the way digital humanities have changed the way literature is studied and approached. Students create their own digital edition as an initiation to digital humanities. To become more familiar with book history, we also visit the Beinecke Library and try the Sterling Library’s printing press. Main authors are Boileau, Boursault, Corneille, Donneau de Visé, Guéret, La Bruyère, Molière, Racine, Scudéry, Segrais, Sévigné.\n\nVisual Kinship, Families, and Photography\nAMST 484, WGSS 462, AMST 729, FILM 810, HSAR 493, WGSS 746\nLaura Wexler\n\nExploration of the history and practice of family photography from an interdisciplinary perspective. Study of family photographs from the analog to the digital era, from snapshots to portraits, and from instrumental images to art exhibitions. Particular attention to the ways in which family photographs have helped establish gendered and racial hierarchies and examination of recent ways of reconceiving these images.\n\nYData: An Introduction to Data Science\nS&amp;DS 123, S&amp;DS 523\nJessica Cisewski and John Lafferty\n\nComputational, programming, and statistical skills are no longer optional in our increasingly data-driven world; these skills are essential for opening doors to manifold research and career opportunities. This course aims to dramatically enhance knowledge and capabilities in fundamental ideas and skills in data science, especially computational and programming skills along with inferential thinking. YData is an introduction to Data Science that emphasizes the development of these skills while providing opportunities for hands-on experience and practice. YData is accessible to students with little or no background in computing, programming, or statistics, but is also engaging for more technically oriented students through extensive use of examples and hands-on data analysis. Python 3, a popular and widely used computing language, is the language used in this course. The computing materials will be hosted on a special purpose web server.\n",

The resulting research will characterize the extent to which wood engravings and other reprographic materials were shared among educational publishers. During the award period, Krewson will extract specific features from page images, such as illustration location, using advances in machine learning.\n\nThe project intends to use the process developed to identify pictorial elements to motivate a new metadata field that describes the location and type of illustrations on the page. An ultimate goal of the project is to move toward “machine-read” texts, where the data generated by classifiers and dimensionality reduction techniques are bundled as metadata with the corresponding volumes and made available to future research.\n\nCongratulations, Stephen!\n\nFor more on the award, visit HathiTrust’s announcement.\n",

As the tether between visual culture and the material world is recalibrated every day, a new form of literacy is required to draw meaning from physical media and its obsolescence. At the very moment when characterization and interpretation of the printed photograph is rapidly gaining ground, the momentum toward dematerialization raises the issue of the long-term relevance and sustainability of photography as a material fact. Does the physical photograph still matter today, as a source for teaching, learning, and scholarship, and will it matter into the future?\n\nThis three-day program is organized by Paul Messier (Director of the Lens Media Lab at Yale’s Institute for the Preservation of Cultural Heritage), Monica Bravo (Assistant Professor of History and Theory of Photographic Media at California College of the Arts), and colleagues at Yale University with the support and guidance of the FAIC Collaborative Workshops in Photograph Conservation advisory committee.\n\nThe program and elective seminars will be geared toward educators, students, curators, photographers, and, particularly, for conservators whose core value proposition is most directly tied to the physical photograph. Insights from conservators, scholars, makers, and the art market will address the premise that physical photography is a closed set. The optional final day of the workshop will model interdisciplinary inquiry and seek to incubate collaborations focused on photography as a medium both material and immaterial. New tools will be examined for characterizing and contextualizing the photograph both as object and disembodied image.\n\nFor the schedule and to register, visit the conference website.\n",

Students work in teams to develop a variety of applications proposed by faculty and staff from the Digital Humanities Lab, the Institute for the Preservation of Cultural Heritage, and the Computer Science department. Meets with CPSC 376. Students may earn credit for CPSC 276 or 376; not both.\n\nPrerequisite: CPSC 223 or equivalent, or permission of the instructor\n\nAncients and Moderns\nFREN 822\nChrisophe Schuwey\n\nWhat does it mean to be new, original, or innovative in literature? On the contrary, what does being traditional imply? What socioeconomic, ideological, and aesthetic issues lie behind those concepts and questions? This seminar addresses these questions at the time they first became central for France, when literature and arts became a market as well as a major political issue. Through literary and metaliterary works (Molière, Desjardins, La Bruyère, Scudéry, Guéret, Perrault) we reconsider our own relationship to novelty, tradition, and literary creation. In order to get hands-on with the most modern evolutions in the field, we also develop a critical edition of La Bruyère’s Les Caractères, a canonical work that looks reactionary in terms of its content and extremely modern in its printing technique. This edition is backed by a Rosenkranz grant for digital humanities in the classroom that will allow us to work with a professional designer.\n\nPrerequisite: French reading, speaking, and writing\n\nClose Analysis of Film\nFILM 320, HSAR 490\nOksana Chefranova\n\nThe goal of this intensive seminar is to develop tools of close analysis of film as a significant art form by learning to identify elements of cinematic representation (mise-en-scène, cinematography, editing, sound, and the basic vocabulary associated with each aspect) and to demonstrate how these constituents combine to create meaning. Through developing a deeper understanding of a particular film, we transition from specific instances to broader considerations such as aesthetic and historical context or ideological critique. The course also traces the history of the close analysis method from structural semiotics and neoformalist analysis to digital humanities. We study films ranging from Hollywood and American filmmaking (Alfred Hitchcock and David Lynch) and European modernism (Robert Bresson and Jean-Luc Godard) to films that use expressive codes and cultural conventions less familiar to us (Lars von Trier and Hou Hsiao-hsien). Topics include genre, the digital image, landscape, body and face, gesture and screen performance, and cinematic atmosphere.\n\nPrerequisite: FILM 150\n\nComputational Tools for Data Science\nAMTH 262, S&amp;DS 262, CPSC 362, S&amp;DS 562\nRoy Lederman\n\nIntroduction to the core ideas and principles that arise in modern data analysis, bridging statistics and computer science and providing students the tools to grow and adapt as methods and techniques change. Topics include principle component analysis, independent component analysis, dictionary learning, neural networks and optimization, as well as scalable computing for large datasets. Assignments will include implementation, data analysis and theory. Students require background in linear algebra, multivariable calculus, probability and programming.\n\nPrerequisites: after or concurrently with MATH 222, 225, or 231; after or concurrently with MATH 120, 230, or ENAS 151; after or concurrently with CPSC 100, 112, or ENAS 130; after S&amp;DS 100-108 or S&amp;DS 230 or S&amp;DS 241 or S&amp;DS 242\n\nComputer Science and the Modern Intellectual Agenda\nCPSC 150\nDavid Gelernter\n\nIntroduction to the basic ideas of computer science (computability, algorithm, virtual machine, symbol processing system), and of several ongoing relationships between computer science and other fields, particularly philosophy of mind.\n\nNo previous experience with computers necessary. Enrollment limited to 25\n\nData and Information Visualization\nCPSC 446, CPSC 546\nHolly Rushmeier\n\nVisualization is a powerful tool for understanding data and concepts. This course provides an introduction to the concepts needed to build new visualization systems, rather than to use existing visualization software. Major topics are abstracting visualization tasks, using visual channels, spatial arrangements of data, navigation in visualization systems, using multiple views, and filtering and aggregating data. Case studies to be considered include a wide range of visualization types and applications in humanities, engineering, science, and social science.\n\nPrerequisite: CPSC 223\n\nData Governance in the Digital Age\nGLBL 395\nNathaniel Raymond\n\nThe information revolution is causing the rapid mass adoption of information communication technologies (ICTs) across nations, demographics, and sectors in the early 21st Century–such as mobile devices, social media platforms, “big data,” artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning, geospatial mapping applications, and the Internet of Things (IoT). However, 20th Century international data governance policies, normative frameworks, and domestic regulations are struggling to keep pace with the disruptive impacts ICTs are having on an increasingly digitally networked world. This seminar explores critical issues, trends, and events relevant to both the adaption of existing data governance regimes to meet these challenges and the creation of new regimes by international organizations, the private sector, civil society, and national governments.\n\nIntroduction to Computing and Programming\nCPSC 100\nBenedict Brown\n\nIntroduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and to the art of programming. Students learn how to think algorithmically and solve problems efficiently. Topics include abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, software engineering, and web development. Languages include C, Python, SQL, and JavaScript, plus CSS and HTML. Problem sets inspired by real-world domains of biology, cryptography, finance, forensics, and gaming. See CS50’s website for additional information.\n\nNo previous programming experience required. Open to students of all levels and majors\n\nIntroduction to Media\nENGL 196, FILM 160\nR. John Williams\n\nIntroduction to the long history of media as understood in classical and foundational (and even more recent experimental) theories. Topics involve the technologies of modernity, reproduction, and commodity, as well as questions regarding knowledge, representation, public spheres, and spectatorship. Special attention given to philosophies of language, visuality, and the environment, including how digital culture continues to shape these realms.\n\nIntroduction to the History of Art: Sacred Art and Architecture\nHSAR 150\nJacqueline Jung\nDH Fellow: Gavi Levy Haskell\n\nA wide-ranging, cross-temporal exploration of religious images, objects, and architecture in diverse cultures, from ancient Mesopotamia to modern Manhattan. Buddhist, Christian, Hindu, Jewish, Muslim, and various polytheistic traditions are represented. Thematic threads include the human body; transformations of nature; death, memory, and afterlife; sacred kingship and other forms of political engagement; practices of concealment and revelation; images as embodiments of the divine; the framing and staging of ritual through architecture.\n\nIntroduction to Web Application for the Digital Humanities\nCPSC 276\nBenedict Brown\n\nIntroduction to applications of computer and data science in the humanities, including web technologies, visualization, and database design. Students work in teams to develop a variety of applications proposed by faculty and staff from the Digital Humanities Lab, the Institute for the Preservation of Cultural Heritage, and the Computer Science department. Meets with CPSC 376. Students may earn credit for CPSC 276 or 376; not both.\n\nPrerequisite: CPSC 110, CPSC 112, equivalent programming experience, or permission of the instructor\n\nLiterature and Philosophy from Locke to Kant\nENGL 729\nJonathan Kramnick\n\nThis is a class on epistemology, aesthetics, and literary form. We read major works in empiricism and moral philosophy alongside poetry and fiction in several genres. We ask, for example, how do poetry, fiction, and the visual arts recruit and account for perceptual experience or consider material and natural objects? What happens when the empirical psychology of consciousness or the categories of the sublime, beautiful, and picturesque take narrative or poetic form? What sort of ethical models follow from formal or generic decisions? We focus throughout on how these topics have been discussed across the history of literary studies, and we pay close attention to current debates in the field, including those prompted by new formalisms and materialisms, critical race studies, cognitive literary studies, and the digital humanities. Authors include Locke, Behn, Defoe, Pope, Addison, Hume, Burke, Sterne, Smith, Kant, and Wordsworth.\n\nPhotography and the Sciences\nHIST 949, HSAR 832, HSHM 656\nChitra Ramalingam\n\nDoes photography belong in the history of art, or does its status as an “automatic” or “scientific” recording technique and its many uses in the sciences distinguish its history from that of earlier visual media? How does photography look when we approach it from the cultural history of science? How might its role in the sciences have shaped photographic aesthetics in the arts? This course examines the making of photography’s discursive identity as an experimental and evidentiary medium in the sciences, from its announcement to the public in 1839 to the digital innovations of the present day. We take a historical and archival perspective on uses for (and debates over) photography in different fields of the natural and human sciences, grounded in visits to photographic collections at Yale.\n\nQuantitative Linguistics using Corpora\nLING 234, 634\nChelsea Sanker\n\nIntroduction to the basics of corpus linguistics. Students learn to compile and process corpora and conduct statistical tests to better understand linguistic patterns and are provided with the background and tools necessary to pursue further research in this area. Digital humanities students from other departments are welcome.\n\nPrerequisite: one entry-level linguistics course (e.g., phonetics, phonology, syntax, and psycholinguistics) or permission of the instructor\n\nSpecial Topics in Music, Multimedia Art, and Technology\nMUSI 425\nKonrad Kaczmarek\n\nLive audio and video processing using the visual programming environment Max/MSP/Jitter. Topics include human computer interaction (HCI), instrument design, alternative controllers, data mapping, algorithmic composition, real-time digital signal processing, communication over the network, and programming for mobile devices.\n",

Relying on the unique Blake holdings at the Yale Center for British Art, the course considers not only Blake’s Milton, but Blake’s artistic and textual treatments of other early modern writers, including Shakespeare, Bacon, Bunyan, and Newton.\n\nDeserts, Oceans, Islands: Literature of Migration &amp; Refuge\nAFST 369, MMES 369, FREN 369\nJill Jarvis\nDH Fellow Carole Delaitre\n\nA critical study of literature and film that charts different spaces shaped by intersecting—or colliding—routes of colonization and forced migration: deserts (Sahara, Sonoran), oceans (Indian, Atlantic, Mediterranean), and islands (Haiti, Martinique, Zanzibar, Mauritius, Sri Lanka). Students contribute to the Desert Futures interdisciplinary symposium to be held at Yale in spring 2020. Seminar is conducted in English.\n\nPrerequisite: Reading knowledge of French required (FREN 160 or above; contact instructor with questions about language preparation).\n\nFake News and True Stories\nFREN 391\nChristophe Schuwey\n\nThe rise of newspapers and the development of the information culture in the age of Versailles deeply transformed French literature and the relationship of readers to truth and fiction. On the one hand, reading the news became a leisure activity, which created issues surprisingly similar to our contemporary ‘fake news’ phenomenon. On the other hand, realism became the new paradigm for literature, as audiences craved stories and plays depicting their own world. Authors turned information, rumors, and gossip into novels, comedies, and tragedies. Through works by Molière, La Fayette, Donneau de Visé, Scudéry, Racine, and Corneille as well as the first newspapers, we explore this critical moment that built our modern relationship to fiction and information.\n\nReading and Writing the Modern Essay\nENGL 120\nDH Fellow Trina Hyun\n\nClose reading of great nonfiction prepares students to develop mastery of the craft of powerful writing in the humanities and in all fields of human endeavor, within the university and beyond. Study of some of the finest essayists in the English language, including James Baldwin, Joan Didion, Leslie Jamison, Jhumpa Lahiri, George Orwell, David Foster Wallace, and Virginia Woolf.

This course aims to dramatically enhance knowledge and capabilities in fundamental ideas and skills in data science, especially computational and programming skills along with inferential thinking. YData is an introduction to Data Science that emphasizes the development of these skills while providing opportunities for hands-on experience and practice. YData is accessible to students with little or no background in computing, programming, or statistics, but is also engaging for more technically oriented students through extensive use of examples and hands-on data analysis. Python 3, a popular and widely used computing language, is the language used in this course. The computing materials will be hosted on a special purpose web server.\n",

It requires 5 course credits from the following areas:\n\n\n  \n    Probability and Statistical Theory: one of S&amp;DS 238, 240, 241, 242.  Advanced students may substitute with S&amp;DS 351 or 364 or EENG 431.\n  \n  \n    Statistical Methodology and Data Analysis: two of S&amp;DS 230, 242, 312, 361, 363.  Econ 136 may be substituted for S&amp;DS 242.\n  \n  \n    Computation and Machine Learning: one from S&amp;DS 262, 355, 365, CPSC 223, 477.  CPSC 323 may be substituted for CPSC 223.\n  \n  \n    A credit of data analysis in a discipline area. This course can be either:\n    \n      S&amp;DS 171 OR 172 if taken in Spring 2020 or later. (For pre-2020 offerings, the equivalent would be two of the 1⁄2-credit seminars-S&amp;DS 170, 171 and 172-that accompanied S&amp;DS 123.)\n      One of the “Data Science in a Discipline Area” courses listed below that have been approved for the data science certificate.\n    \n  \n\n\nStudents are required to earn at least a B- in each course counted towards the certificate (or a Pass for courses taken in Spring 2020). No course may be used to fulfill more than one requirement of the certificate.  Also, no course may be counted towards both the certificate and a major.\n\nStudents are encouraged to take an introductory course, such as S&amp;DS 100, 10X, 123, or 220 (or an introductory data analysis course in another department), before taking courses for the certificate.\n\nThe qualifying “Data Science in a Discipline Area” courses expose students to how data are gathered and used within a discipline outside of S&amp;DS. The courses currently approved for this purpose are:\n\n\n  ANTH 376, Observing and Measuring Behavior\n  ASTR 356, Astrostatistics and Data Mining\n  ECON 438, Applied Econometrics: Politics, Sports, Microeconomics\n  ECON 439, Applied Econometrics: Macroeconomic and Finance Forecasting\n  EVST 362, Observing Earth from Space\n  GLBL 191, Research Design and Survey Analysis\n  LING 227, Language and Computation I\n  LING 229, Language and Computation II\n  LING 234, Quantitative Linguistics using Corpora\n  LING 380, Neural Networks and Language\n  MB&amp;B 452 / MCDB 452 / S&amp;DS 352, Biomedical Data Science, Mining and Modeling\n  PLSC 340 / S&amp;DS 315, Measuring Impact and Opinion Change\n  PLSC 341 / GLBL 195, Logic of Randomized Experiments in Political Science\n  PLSC 454, Data Science for Politics and Policy\n  PSYC 235, Research Methods in Psychology\n  PSYC 258 / NSCI 258, Computational Methods in Human Neuroscience\n  PSYC 438 / NSCI 441, Computational Models of Human Behavior\n  S&amp;DS 171, YData: Text Data Science: An Introduction (if taken in Spring 2020 or later)\n  S&amp;DS 172, YData: Data Science for Political Campaigns (if taken in Spring 2020 or later)\n  S&amp;DS 173, YData: Analysis of Baseball Data (if taken in Spring 2020 or later).\n\n\nThe department is planning to expand the list of courses above to more disciplines.\n\nSuggestions and Caveats\n\nThe department recommends that most students take a 100-level course, followed by 238 or 240, 230, and one of 361 or 363.\n\nStudents may not count courses toward both their major and the certificate. If a course in the certificate is required by a student’s major, then the student should substitute a different course in the certificate.\n\nStudents considering majoring in Statistics and Data Science should be very careful about which courses they take. Some courses that count towards the certificate (right now 240 and 355) do NOT count towards the major. S&amp;DS majors may not pursue the Data Science certificate.\n\nFor more information and to register, visit the S&amp;DS webpage.

Designed to be taken as a sequence, these workshops will progress from introductory to more advanced techniques using the Python programming language. Each session will be grounded in data and research questions that are important in the humanities.\n\nWorkshops will be held over Zoom and are open to all Yale students, faculty, and staff, but space will be limited. Registration will open shortly, so check back soon for updates!\n\nFor tutorials from past Digital Humanities Lab workshops, visit the DHLab’s GitHub repository.\n\nPython for Humanists Workshop Series\n\nFirst Steps with Python\nOctober 1, 3:00 p.m. Eastern\n\nCurious about Python but not sure where to start? This workshop will introduce the basics of programming in Python. Participants will learn how to perform common tasks in Python in order to build familiarity with the language’s syntax and best practices.\n\nCollecting Data with APIs \nOctober 15, 3:00 p.m. Eastern\n\nLearn how to retrieve online data via an Application Programming Interface (API).  Many libraries, museums, and galleries worldwide are digitizing their collections and making them available for data mining via APIs. In this workshop, we’ll cover what APIs are, along with how and why you might use them.\n\nParsing Data with Python \nOctober 22, 3:00 p.m. Eastern\n\nDevelop techniques for wrangling messy data with Python. Oftentimes, data retrieved online needs to be transformed or otherwise parsed before it can become usable for your research. In this workshop, we’ll walk through using Beautiful Soup, a Python library for extracting data from HTML and XML files\n\nGetting Started with Networks  \nOctober 29, 3:00 p.m. Eastern\n\nThis workshop will provide a broad overview of network analysis. After covering what networks are and how to read them, instructors will open two breakout rooms: one will teach how to generate networks using Gephi (off-the-shelf software, no programming required) and the other will walk through using NetworkX (a Python library for creating networks). Participants will have the option to choose which breakout room they will join.\n\nBuilding Classifiers with Python  \nNovember 5, 3:00 p.m. Eastern\n\nThis workshop will offer an introduction to classification techniques in machine learning. We will discuss some of the many use cases for classification techniques—including spam detection, named entity recognition, and plagiarism detection—as well as the mechanics behind popular classification algorithms. Finally, we will build our own classifier and will classify observations in a prepared dataset that will be provided to participants.\n\nExtracting Color with Python \nDecember 3, 3:00 p.m. Eastern\n\nMany programming workshops focus on how you can use Python for text analysis, but in fact, it is also useful for studying images at scale. In this workshop, we’ll demonstrate how we can use Python to extract color palettes from a collection of images. Along with discussing popular technical approaches, we will also introduce color spaces and theories of color perception, which will affect what algorithms we choose for specific tasks.\n\nIdentifying Similar Images with Python\nDecember 10, 3:00 p.m. Eastern\n\nThis workshop will focus on the task of identifying similar images at scale, but we will also discuss how you can apply same techniques when working with texts as well. We will cover the process of converting cultural heritage materials into “vectors”, the basics of working with vector spaces, and the ways we can use vector spaces to identify similar images and texts.\n\n",

However, there is interaction between humans and the vernacular spaces and it is only fitting that the richness of these personal encounters, each a little different from the other, is also captured in Yale’s existing New Haven Building Archive (NHBA).\n\nIn collaboration with Elihu Rubin, Associate Professor of Architecture and American Studies, the Digital Humanities Lab created NHBA as an online collection of architecture in and around the Yale University campus. The desktop and mobile-friendly website features hundreds of encyclopedia-like entries of researched buildings, a visual map of buildings filterable by style, era, usage, and neighborhood, and a glossary of architectural terms for quick reference.\n\n\n\nFor my senior project in fulfillment of the Computer Science major, I extended upon the existing codebase with the aim of moving NHBA closer to that of a “living archive.” By allowing users to contribute documents, such as image snapshots, and add comments in the style of a discussion forum, the building entries are now ever-changing collections of personal encounters and experiences with the Yale campus. The flows for image and comment contributions are similar: users can submit a form with their attached documents, which then must be reviewed by the admins via a portal display, and finally, the approved media will be appended to the existing building entry. In addition, I helped visualize the glossary page by embedding an image gallery for each term definition to make the tool more robust and accessible.\n\nI could not have asked for a better opportunity to culminate my Yale experience. Through this project, I could combine my passions for web development without sacrificing my love for the humanities, all the while incorporating the knowledge I’ve gained from two of my favorite courses: Professor Rubin’s ARCH 280: “American Architecture and Urbanism” (whose students contribute to the NHBA every semester) and my advisor Professor Benedict Brown’s CPSC 376: “Digital Humanities.” I hope that my work on creating a “living archive” of the NHBA will bring the Yale community one step closer together and make the campus and the greater New Haven cityscape feel a bit more familiar.\n\nSince graduating from Yale, Xiu Chen has accepted a position as a software engineer at Facebook.

Her accompanying book, The Decisive Network: Magnum Photos and the Postwar Image Market, was published this July and is available from University of California Press.\n\nBair’s project is the first to systematically examine Magnum’s early operations. Rather than studying the agency’s photographers in isolation, Bair argues that they belonged to a larger “decisive network,” a community of professionals who helped photographers attain success. This network included editors, publishers, secretaries, spouses, and sales agents; many were women, and many have been missing until now from histories of photography.\n\nInside the Decisive Network was designed to reflect the collaborative, interconnected nature of Magnum’s work. Developed in collaboration with Yale’s Digital Humanities Lab (DHLab), the site draws on a range of digital methods—mapping, network analysis, and online exhibits of Magnum photos—to illustrate the breadth of Magnum’s activities after World War II. Visitors can browse detailed profiles of the agency’s staff members, visualize the expansion of Magnum’s network of agents in Europe, and peruse commentary on iconic photo essays.\n\nBair’s work reveals that the history of photojournalism is not just one narrative, but many: the stories of the simultaneous labor of multiple people, developed on concurrent tracks. Inside the Decisive Network sheds new light not only on this important agency’s activities, but on photojournalism and postwar visual culture more broadly.\n\nInside the Decisive Network was developed during Bair’s time as a Postdoctoral Associate with the Yale DHLab and American Studies.

These are the most highly resolved, full-coverage maps of Japan, showing details at the level of individual trees, wells, and power lines. Although the neural network excerpted municipal (町村) boundaries, there are some gaps that need to be closed  manually. Your job will be to close these gaps, then divide the municipalities into Edo-period villages using information from other maps that the lab has collected and georeferenced. The lab will teach you how to work with the specific functions in ArcGIS Pro. Other tasks are likely to arise over the course of the project, including literature searches at Sterling Memorial Library.\n\nQualifications:\n\n  Attention to detail.\n  Interest in digital humanities, history, and/or historical geography.\n  Basic knowledge of Japanese history would be a plus.\n  Although it is not required for this position, the ability to read or recognize Japanese or Chinese characters would be an advantage.

What is lost in the process? This course explores how we can use computational methods to pursue questions in the humanities, while also looking at how humanistic methods can inform the work of algorithms in research and society at large. Each course week is divided into discussion and lab sessions. Discussion sessions introduce concepts and humanities-based case studies that ground the hands-on technical work done in the labs.

AI’s impact is a question of economics: how will machine labor replace and alter human labor in the pursuit of greater efficiency and profitability? It is also question of aesthetics: how will machine vision and cognition alter and replace human creativity? Understanding this new machine-mediated visual culture is critical to addressing its growth, finding potentials and opportunities, and identifying avenues for critique and resistance.\n\nJames Baldwin’s American Scene\nAFAM 228, AMST 385, ENGL 265, HUMS 241\nJacqueline Goldsby\n\nThis course offers an in-depth examination of James Baldwin’s canon, tracking his work as an American artist, citizen, and witness to United States society, politics, and culture during the Cold War, the Civil Rights era, and the Black Arts Movement. Students will have the opportunity to learn digital tools for projects in the class.\n\nListening to Music\nMUSI 175 \nAngharad Davis\nDH Fellow Jacqueline Georgis\n\nThis course will contribute to the development of aural skills that will lead to an understanding of Western music.

We explore the politics of mapping, geography, and race before delving into a place-based exploration of black religious communities during the late 19th century. The course aims to investigate the extant archives of black Christian communities of the post-emancipation South: newspapers, convention and church minutes, encyclopedias and autobiographies and narratives, while applying strategies of historical analysis to explore the nature of the formation and transformation of African American religious community.\n\nReadings in Literary Japanese\nJAPN 171\nDH Fellow Mary Gilstad\n\nThis course is the second semester of a two-semester program in the premodern languages of Japan designed to give students the tools to enjoy and pursue research in Japanese premodern and early modern texts. Students will be introduced to the variety of digital tools already in use for the teaching and learning of literary Japanese.

Here are a few that will help you learn about digital mapping and design, examine the social implications of new technologies, gain proficiency in a programming language, and more. Course offerings range from theoretical considerations of technology and big data to hands-on practice with digital tools and methods. For more detailed information about prerequisites and enrollment, please see the full course descriptions at courses.yale.edu.\n\nIf you are teaching a course connected to DH and would like it included in the list below, or if you would like someone from the Yale Digital Humanities Lab to speak with your class, please email the DHLab.\n\nCoded Design\nART 750\nErin Sparling\n\nThis course teaches students to apply the medium of the Internet to the practice of design, and considers how the shape and properties of information influence the digital surfaces around us. Students bring their interest in understanding the nature of systems, develop new ways of looking at their own work through the lens of code, and conceptualize novel social experiences in distributed design. The class examines how HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and API allow the web browser to be a method for creating the digital world around us, deepening our understanding of the information economy that feeds creation and consumption online. Prior experience with programming or HTML recommended, but not required.\n\nLaw, Technology, and Culture\nCPSC 183\nBrad Rosen\n\nAn exploration of the myriad ways in which law and technology intersect, with a special focus on the role of cyberspace. Topics include digital copyright, free speech, privacy and anonymity, information security, innovation, online communities, the impact of technology on society, and emerging trends. No previous experience with computers or law necessary.\n\nEconomics of Artificial Intelligence and Innovation\nECON 472\nEvangelia Chalioti\n\nThis course studies the economics of innovation and the effects of artificial intelligence on different industries. Topics include economics of the intellectual property (IP) protection system, strategic choices in innovation and competition, patent races, measurement and big data, the sharing and digitalized economy, collective intelligence and decisions, online auctions, venture capital, and legal and social infrastructure.\n\nModeling Geographic Objects\nENV 756\nCharles Tomlin\n\nThis course offers an introduction to the nature and use of drawing-based (vector) geographic information systems (GIS) for the preparation, interpretation, and presentation of digital cartographic data. The course is oriented more toward discrete objects in geographical space (e.g., water bodies, land parcels, or structures) than the qualities of that space itself (e.g., proximity, density, or interspersion). No previous experience is required.\n\nData Governance in the Digital Age\nGLBL 395\nNathaniel Raymond\n\nThe information revolution is causing the rapid mass adoption of information communication technologies (ICTs) across nations, demographics, and sectors, such as mobile devices, social media platforms, “big data,” artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, geospatial mapping applications, and the Internet of Things (IoT). However, 20th-century international data governance policies, normative frameworks, and domestic regulations are struggling to keep pace with the disruptive impacts ICTs are having on an increasingly digitally networked world. This seminar explores critical issues, trends, and events relevant to the adaptation of existing data governance regimes to meet these challenges, as well as the creation of new regimes by international organizations, the private sector, civil society, and national governments.\n\nIntroduction to Python for Global Affairs\nGLBL 550\nWilliam King\n\nIn the second decade of the 21st century, “big data” analytics and techniques have fundamentally transformed policy decisions both in the United States and throughout the globe. NGOs, NPOs, political campaigns, think tanks, and government agencies more and more recruit policy analysts with the necessary skills to embrace novel, data-driven approaches to policy creation and evaluation. This introductory course in Python programming and data analysis, aimed at policy students with no prior coding experience, is designed to help students meet this growing demand for “tech humanists.” Ultimately, it aims to prepare students to use what they’ve learned in further Yale courses in programming and statistics, or in research and policy after leaving Yale.\n\nIntroduction to Syriac Christianity\nRLST 420, REL 770\nMaria Doerfler\n\nThis seminar aims to introduce students to the literary, historical, and theological tradition of Syriac Christianity and the developing field of Syriac Christian studies. Students will encounter a number of the tradition’s key authors; learn to locate its development in the context of different imperial cultures and religious interlocutors, including Judaism and Islam; and explore topics at the vanguard of current scholarship, including distinctive approaches to asceticism, ritual, and historiography. In addition to weekly meetings, the seminar further requires attendance for three special sessions: a visit to the Beinecke Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library and its considerable Syriac manuscript holdings; a visit to the Yale University Art Gallery and its collection of relevant artifacts and coins; and an introduction to the use of digital humanities in Syriac studies through the Yale Digital Dura-Europos Archive (YDEA).\n\nComputers, Networks, and Society\nSOCY 133\nScott Boorman\n\nThis course offers a comparison of major algorithm-centered approaches to the analysis of complex social network and organizational data, and aims to develop a disciplined, coherent perspective on modern information technology’s effects on societies worldwide. Topics include software warfare and algorithm sabotage; blockmodeling and privacy; and legal, ethical, and policy issues. No prior experience with computers required.\n",

The effectiveness of the method has been tested on a large corpus of medieval manuscripts that has different writing styles and has been affected by other factors, such as ink bleed-through, background noise, and overtyping text lines.\n\nGoals &amp; Methods\n\nATHENA presents a parameter-free, automatic method to perform text height estimation. Given the image of a manuscript page, a multi-scale representation is first produced. Then, for each sub-image at each level, a robust, frequency-based descriptor is computed. Finally, a voting procedure finds the predominant spatial frequency in the document page, whose period is the value of the text height. This proves to be an efficient and reliable technique in the case of very noisy and damaged old handwritten manuscripts. The major contributions of the proposed approach include the following:\n\nFrequency-based descriptor. A new local image descriptor based on a frequency analysis of the y-axis projected profile of the normalized image autocorrelation function\n\nMulti-scale framework. A multi-level approach with a voting procedure to exploit spatial consistency between frequency-based image descriptors at different scale levels\n\nEvaluation.

This project wishes to study, on a micro- and macro-level, the changes Blake made to his plates over time in order to better understand his use of color and affect.\n\nThe visualizations in BlakeTint give us fresh ways of looking at Blake’s manuscripts, providing new angles into understanding his complicated relationship with color.\n\nOn a macro-level, users can track:\n\n  how Blake’s color palette changes across the course of one book (from plate-to-plate)\n  how Blake’s coloring of one book changes across copies (sorting by book)\n  how Blake’s general color scheme across all his books progresses over time (sorting by date).\n\n\nOn a micro-level, you can:\n\n  spot minute differences and alterations Blake made to a single plate, using a sliding tool that compares two copies of the same image\n  compare color palettes of two plates, bar-for-bar, side-by-side\n  view a plate’s color palette multiple ways: equal-sized, proportional, and hue-only\n  examine what the computer “sees” when it removes the background color from each plate and extracts the remaining color palette.\n\n\n\n\nContact\nBlakeTint will be launching for public use shortly.

It came above ground in August 1944, at the Liberation of Paris, and soon came to represent in the public mind the spirit of the Resistance in post-war France. The newspaper’s editors, Albert Camus and Pascal Pia, assembled a group of young, forward-thinking writers and intellectuals who reported nationally and internationally on politics and culture. The paper nourished the careers of many important writers and thinkers and set a high standard in the press for its style and intellectual ambitions. Camus’s editorials, eagerly read and debated, explored the polemics  and moral issues of the day,from the punishment of collaborators to the consequences of Hiroshima.\n\nOur team is mapping a network of contributors based on an index of signed and unsigned articles published in Combat from 1944-1947. We are working with a searchable .pdf of a full collection of the newspaper, obtained from the French national library with the support of Yale’s Digital Humanities Laboratory. We are tracking variables such as author, title of article, political affinity of the author, author’s nationality, and the number of articles translated from other languages.\n\n\nCamus and the editorial team gathered to toast the New Year, January 2, 1945. Photo taken by Combat photographer René Saint-Paul. Photo credit: René Saint-Paul, Rue des Archives.\n\nGuiding Research Questions\n\n\n  \n    Did Combat  operate as a “feeder” to other magazines and publishing houses? How much overlap was there between Combat and the contributors to L’Arche, Fontaine, La Nef, Esprit, Action, etc.?\n  \n  \n    Did the writers at Combat really belong to a new generation? How many writers already known in the 1920s and 1930s occupied its pages? How many writers compromised under Vichy? How many Communists? How many Gaullists?\n  \n  \n    Our index of titles allows us to measure the amount of space given to various issues. How much film criticism? How much political coverage—national and international? How soon did the newspaper acknowledge the death camps? How did it cover the massacres at Sétif in 1945? What names and events appear repeatedly?\n  \n  \n    Women won the right to vote in 1944. How did Combat measure this sea change? How many women wrote for the newspaper?\n  \n  \n    What is Combat’s geographical frame of reference —to what cities and countries does it refer? Is Germany, the vanquished enemy, the most frequently cited? What about French anxiety—or enthusiasm—over “Americanization”? How many foreign writers did it publish? How many translations?\n  \n  \n    Do the categories “right” and “left” apply to Combat? Its motto is “from Resistance to Revolution” and yet it was fiercely anti-Stalinist.  How does it convey its political views in the postwar landscape, especially in contrast to the other major post-war newspapers (L’Humanité, Le Monde, Le Figaro, Le Parisien libéré)?\n  \n\n\nThis project received a grant from the French Embassy Centers of Excellence in 2020.

      "content": "Digitizing and Humanizing Our Own Backyards\nby Benjamin Oldfield\n\nAs a primary care pediatrician and health services researcher, I think often about the local milieu of my patients. How do social and structural forces at the neighborhood level contribute positively and negatively to a family’s health? Investigating that question requires several kinds of data—geospatial, survey data, local history, narrative, to name a few—in short, a perfect project for the digital humanities. And what better way to approach the question than in partnership with New Haven’s youth, experts themselves on their own neighborhoods.\n\nTogether with Jerry Smart (a community health worker at Yale’s Transitions Clinic), Catherine DeRose (Digital Humanities Lab), and Miriam Olivares (GIS Librarian), we organized a five-day workshop for students of Yale’s Pathways to Science high school program, bringing them into the DHLab and then out into their own New Haven communities to collect and analyze data. The work was sponsored by a Seed Grant from the DHLab. For this pilot workshop, we focused on one important determinant of neighborhood health: local food systems.\n\nThe workshop began with a guided tour through New Haven’s Newhallville neighborhood, where we discussed how space and place can impact and be impacted by health and wellbeing. We then took these ideas into the DHLab, where Catherine and Miriam provided us tools we could use to organize and visualize what we saw. One such tool, ESRI’s StoryMaps, provided an easily learnable platform for integrating text, survey, photo, video, and geospatial data all into one collaborative website. In small groups, we then went out into various New Haven neighborhoods to capture such data at small food establishments—interviewing store owners, documenting acceptance of food stamps or WIC, photographing facades and videoing our own shopping experience—to build a spatial library of corner stores.\n\nThe students left the workshop with a completed website, new notions about food systems and the health of their city, and a toolbox for future projects. I was impressed at all they accomplished, and at the vast potential for youth-partnered research. I learned that the DHLab can be an important outlet for building youth capacity for research, particularly because it asks that they engage their creative sides, their scientific sides, and their storytelling sides all at once in order to create an engaging and beautiful product.

Numbering nearly 900, the earliest date to the eighth century and the latest to ca. 100 BCE. The purpose of the Cuneiform Commentaries Project (CCP) is to make the corpus available both to the scholarly community and a more general audience by providing background information on the genre, a searchable catalog, and also photos, drawings, annotated editions, and translations of individual commentary tablets. For the first time the cuneiform commentaries, currently scattered over 21 museums around the globe, will be accessible on one platform. CCP has been funded by Yale University (2013-2016) and the National Endowment for the Humanities (Division of Research Programs “Scholarly Editions and Translations,” 2015-2018).\n\nGoals &amp; Methods\n\nThe first stage of the project entailed the creation of a searchable electronic database for the corpus and its publication online. The final version of the database includes 40 fields and allows searches based on many different criteria. Work on the catalog began in September 2013 and came to an end in August 2014. The bibliographical component of the catalog aims at being exhaustive, and in some cases up to thirty-five references are given (as in CCP 4.2.M.a). The catalog is now available in its entirety and continues to be updated on a regular basis.\n\nThe second goal of the project is to offer photographs of as many commentary tablets as possible, especially the unpublished tablets from the British Museum and those for which no photograph is available at the Cuneiform Digital Library Initiative (CDLI) or at the British Museum’s online catalog. Currently, the photographic archive of the CCP consists of more than 5,000 photographs of almost 200 tablets, which represents some 20% of all commentary tablets known. The photos will constitute a key resource for all future study on Mesopotamian commentaries.\n\nThe third goal of the Cuneiform Commentaries Project is to produce a significant number of full editions of Babylonian and Assyrian commentaries. In this respect the project makes full use of the splendid set of tools created by Steve Tinney for the Open Richly Annotated Cuneiform Corpus (Oracc), and is fortunate enough to count on the generous help of Niek Veldhuis. Editions are being regularly uploaded to the project’s Oracc subproject, the Cuneiform Commentaries Project on Oracc (CCPo), from where they are embedded directly in the project’s website. The project’s website has been developed by Dr. Enrique Jiménez using the YaleSites/Drupal platform maintained by Yale ITS.\n",

This project fuses expertise in machine learning, dance practice and choreographic theory, experimental particle physics, and the humanities to create open-source tools for multifaceted applications in dance and movement research.\n\nUnlike other Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)-based generative dance models introduced in recent publications, our models are designed to serve as beginner-friendly, open-source software resources for dance artists who wish to incorporate machine learning into their practice.

Still in existence, Magnum has become a highly respected and recognizable brand. Exhibitions and books about the agency are produced each year, focusing on Magnum’s legendary founders and their iconic, black-and-white photographs. The business side is rarely part of Magnum’s story because it complicates Magnum’s mythologies, especially that of the photographer as a “concerned” witness to history, and the photographer as an artist, on the hunt for “decisive moments.”\n\nInside the Decisive Network was motivated by larger questions about the workings of photography and the press. If Magnum was so important, what exactly was its contribution to the industry and profession of photojournalism? How did it operate day-to-day? And how did it fit into the broader media landscape after World War II?\n\nBased in years of research in archives around the world, this digital project—and the book that it accompanies—is the first attempt to systematically examine Magnum’s early operations. It argues that Magnum’s photographers were core members of a larger, “decisive network” of professionals who helped photographers attain success. This network included editors, secretaries, and sales agents – many of them women, and many of them missing from histories of photography.\n\nEach section of the site looks at different collaborations and transactions that underpinned Magnum’s operations and the industry of photojournalism after World War II.\n\nIn “Staff,” visitors can see who worked in Magnum’s New York and Paris offices and what they contributed to the organization.\n\n\n\nIn “Agents,” visitors can explore how Magnum’s pictures were distributed and sold in postwar Europe.\n\n\n\nIn “Stories,” visitors can examine Magnum’s photo essays as they appeared in magazines around the world.\n\n\n\nVisualizing the Story: Motivation and Methods\n\nHistory is often written according to a chronological and linear narrative. Yet the industry of photojournalism developed on multiple, concurrent tracks and involved the simultaneous labor of many people.\n\nThis site is an experiment in visually telling the story of Magnum’s activities in the decade after World War II. It integrates a number of methods that are integral to digital scholarship, including mapping and the study of networks, while taking a customized approach to how this information is represented.\n\nEarly attempts to study Magnum using ready-made software such as Gephi and Carto yielded unsatisfactory results. Representing the 1940s and 1950s with out-of-the-box visualization tools made little sense. The design of this project is inspired by the mid-century magazines and publicity brochures found on the desks of Magnum employees. It features custom network graphs and custom montages of Magnum photo essays designed by Yale’s UX Designer Monica Ong Reed using Adobe XD. It also uses archival photographs, which show that networks of professionals were often hiding in plain sight. For instance, Bert Stern’s 1957 portrait of Magnum, which appeared on the cover of Exposure magazine in 1982 and is the introductory image on the staff page here, shows Magnum photographers and staff in almost a 1:1 ratio.\n\nOther components of the site, including the timeline of staff career trajectories and the country essays that describe the role of Magnum’s agents, required more data than was initially available from a close reading of the archive. Making the archive searchable became crucial so that more data could be extracted quickly. With the help of a Google product called Tesseract, Yale’s Developer Douglas Duhaime converted thousands of reproductions of archival documents (stored as jpeg and tiff files) into txt files. He then built a simple database, which implements a client-side binary tree, to allow users to search documents quickly. Mining the archive for various staff members or magazine titles became instantaneous.\n\nFor more information on the project, please contact the project author, Nadya Bair.\n",

Although comprehensive shogunal surveys of feudal ownership exist for two moments in time—1664 and ca. 1868—maps drawing on this data have not fully rendered Tokugawa Japan’s complex territorial ownership structures.

He is the subject of intense scholarly interest because of his significance as an historical figure and the profound legacy he left on America’s religious and intellectual landscapes. His writings are being consulted at a burgeoning rate by religious leaders, pastors, and churches worldwide because of the fervency of Edwards’s message and the acumen with which he appraised religious experience.

The project site consists of four parts: Site History, Architecture and Urbanism, Material Journeys, People and Building.\n\nSite History\n\nThrough maps and other archival documents, this section explores how the land on which the new colleges are being built has changed over time. Once a nameless field abutting the town cemetery, a wood, and a marshy depression that became a canal and then a railroad, it came to hold several notable buildings in the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries, some of them University-affiliated. Yale’s decision to start from scratch in constructing the new residential colleges introduces an architectural coherence that has never before existed in this part of New Haven.\n\nArchitecture and Urbanism\n\nThe new colleges expand upon the architectural tradition established by James Gamble Rogers at Yale’s Memorial Quadrangle (1917-1921), as well as more distant and more immediate references. In addition, the colleges represent a new chapter in the shifting boundaries of campus and city. This section uses the considerable research already done on Yale’s campus architecture to contextualize the new designs by the office of Robert A.M. Stern and examine how architecture affects the urban fabric of New Haven.\n\nMaterial Journeys\n\nNo different than the ingredients on one’s dinner plate, each building material or component can be traced back through a chain of suppliers, fabricators, and producers, revealing both economic and ecological processes. This section seeks to map the journeys of several architectural materials, revealing wider geographies set in motion by the process of building.\n\nPeople and Buildings\n\nThe story of a building is in part composed of the stories of the people who make it, occupy it, maintain it, and otherwise find their lives affected by it. Research on life in and around Yale’s older residential colleges will serve as a framework for original interviews and oral histories with architects, students, University officials, builders, facilities staff, and New Haven residents to find out what the new residential colleges mean to them.\n",

      "content": "Overview\n\nIntertext is a tool for detecting and visualizing textual reuse. Combining machine learning methods with interactive data visualizations, it allows users to explore the dynamics of literary influence, reference, quotation, and allusion within collections of texts, and to track these dynamics over time.\n\nVisualizing Similarity and Influence\n\nTextual reuse raises significant social and historical questions for literary scholars. When—and why—do texts fade in and out of fashion? Which passages are most recycled, and by whom? Are particular textual features more prone to being reused? What networks of authorial influence and affiliation do these practices reveal?\n\nIntertext offers insight into these issues through a mode of textual processing based on minhashing vectorized strings. Each work is broken down into overlapping windows of text, then further subdivided into smaller overlapping sequences of three characters each. Comparing these three-character strings in different texts produces measures of textual similarity—measures that are nuanced enough to identify not just verbatim quotation, but also more complex relationships like parody and allusion.\n\nUsers can explore these similarity measurements through Intertext’s web viewer, which is constructed from interactive React.js components. The web viewer allows users to examine results at two scales: a macro-level view across multiple texts and a micro-level deep-dive into individual texts.\n\n\nView from Intertext (version 0.1.0) of the most frequently reused passages in a collection.\n\nFor a larger-scale view, users can search for a specific author or title, then peruse a list of passages that reuse text from throughout the selected work. The results can be filtered to show either previous uses (text that the author or work is reusing from other sources) or later uses (selections of the text that subsequently were reused by other authors).\n\n\nSearch results for a specific author on the Intertext web viewer (version 0.1.0).\n\nTo zoom in on individual works and passages, users can experiment with Intertext’s “Compare” function, which tracks all instances of one specific passage in a corpus.\n\n\nThe “Compare” feature on the Intertext web viewer (version 0.1.0), with a side-by-side comparison of two passages.\n\nThe “Visualize” feature divides a text into color-coded segments. These can be shaded and organized to reflect 1) the frequency with which these segments are reused, 2) their level of similarity to a passage in another work, or 3) the years in which similar passages appear.\n\n\nThe “Visualize” feature on the Intertext web viewer (version 0.1.0), with color-coded blocks representing similarity to passages in other works.\n\nFuture Developments and Additional Resources\n\nUpdates to Intertext will study how modes of distant reading can be built around intertextuality and repetition, and will examine how these practices can allow us to navigate textual corpora. In addition to expanding Intertext’s visualization features, upcoming work will consider the tool’s functionality as a reading environment.\n\nThose studying textual reuse may also wish to consult additional tools alongside Intertext. Possible resources of interest include:\n\n  David Smith’s passim package\n  TextPAIR (Pairwise Alignment for Intertextual Relations), a digital humanities package from the University of Chicago’s ARTFL Project\n  most especially, Eric Zhu’s datasketch package, which features a useful implementation of the minhash algorithm\n\n\nAn extensive discussion of minhashing can be found in Jure Leskovec, Anand Rajaraman, and Jeff Ullman’s Mining of Massive Datasets, chapter 3: “Finding Similar Items.”\n\nTo use Intertext with your own data set, or to explore sample data, please visit the DHLab’s GitHub repository.\n",

While each testimony is the unique story of an individual, one commonly shared sentiment is the desire to tell the world. Thanks to the willingness of survivors to speak, despite the considerable emotional difficulty of doing so, hundreds of scholars, archivists, and volunteers have been able to study and learn from their experiences. Nevertheless, the sheer number of available testimonies, as well as the lack of transcripts and appropriate search tools, have remained a significant barrier to understanding the Holocaust from the perspective of the survivor. The overall goal of Let Them Speak is to make victims’ perspectives investigable and tangible for future generations.\n\nUnprecedented Archival Access\n\nIn 2018, under the initiative of the Yale Library’s Fortunoff Video Archive for Holocaust Testimonies, three leading institutions responsible for large collections of Holocaust testimonies agreed to make a portion of their materials available as transcripts, along with a subset of video recordings, in Let Them Speak.\nThe Fortunoff Video Archive for Holocaust Testimonies (FVAHT) gave access to 180 transcripts and videos recorded as part of the Holocaust Survivor Film Project in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum (USHMM) contributed 1,500 interviews recorded between the 1970s and the late 1990s. The Visual Archive of the Shoah Foundation at the University of Southern California (USC VA) gave 1,000 interview transcripts recorded in the 1990s.\n\nWith funding from the Fortunoff Video Archive, Let Them Speak was edited and built by Gabor M. Toth in collaboration with the Yale Digital Humanities Laboratory and in consultation with FVAHT, USC VA, and USHMM. The edition brings together for the first time nearly 3,000 testimonies from these three collections, allowing for unprecedented forms of access, search, and analysis of these survivors’ experiences.\n\nThe site is currently in development.

The project covers the period 1914-1926, from the outbreak of the first world war to the full-blown emergence of English modernism. The Lab has supported undergraduate classes on Modern Poetry, the Modern British Novel, Modernist London, and Joyce’s Ulysses, and a graduate course in English and Comparative Literature, as well as a class on modern German literature at the University of Notre Dame. Students in the classes have contributed materials to the website and used it as the platform for their research. The main components of the website are an innovative research tool, YNote, containing information on the activities of 24 leading modernist writers during this crucial period and a wiki consisting of brief interpretive essays on literary works and movements of the period.\n\nThe project as a whole aims to reconstitute the social and intellectual webs that linked these writers—correspondence, personal acquaintance, reading habits—and their influence on the major works of the period. We are interested, too, in broadening the canon of works studied in the period by paying attention to minor works by major authors, major works by minor authors, and works that may have been influential in their time but that are often no longer read.\n\nQuestions of particular importance for our research involve the modernists’ engagement with their literary, intellectual, and historical context. We are particularly interested in Anglo-European literary relations. A typical question of this sort would be, “How did the translations of Dostoevsky by Constance Garnett influence English writing in the period?” Another major concern is the tracing of intellectual trends: “How and when did psychoanalysis make its impact felt in modernist writing?” We pay particular attention to the literary manifestations of a broader historical context, including the modernists’ involvement with political movements such as socialism, feminism, liberalism, nationalism, and imperialism. Another major theme is the attitudes of these writers to formal religion and to alternatives such as atheism, neo-paganism, spiritualism, and the occult. The database traces the empirical information—such as references to Dostoevsky or Freud or Tagore in writers’ correspondence—while the wiki offers interpretive accounts of how these influences played out in the modernists’ formal and thematic concerns.\n",

In 1978, when John Ashbery purchased his first and only house in Hudson, New York, he began an intensive project of creating his ideal vision of a home. Although not well known as a collector, he had actually begun to study American antiques in childhood, composing some of his earliest poems about objects he found. From the 1950s to the 1980s, he also amassed hundreds of new, small collections while also writing about them (ceramics, wallpaper, etc.) in art reviews, in essays for popular magazines on eclectic collectors and their homes, and in provocative new poems. Painstakingly restored over a fifteen-year period, his house became a frame for these assemblages, providing a place to display his discoveries and continue to learn from them.\n\nWhile the Hudson House has always been a private space, this project provides, through a website highlighting Ashbery’s creation of each room (including photographs, biographical details, archival records, and audio clips of Ashbery and his partner, David Kermani, discussing each room), both crucial documentation and an experience of how he has used and imagined the home. Links to related poetic texts demonstrate how deeply objects and houses have resonated in Ashbery’s artistic life.\n\nUsing new virtual reality technologies to explore rooms and interact with objects inside the house, Nest enables users to experience the intimacy of being in “the middle of things,” a reality that echoes in Ashbery’s greatest poems.\n\nA collaboration with Karin Roffman, the Yale Digital Humanities Lab, VR Habitat, and Yale ITS, Nest launched in 2017 with a prototype of the Center Hall.

In using the extant corpus of secondary materials that scholars and print humanists have created, combined with Murray-related primary sources as data, the project intends to glean patterns, trajectories, and discrepancies between the two that are otherwise unseen or too overwhelming for traditional source analyses to capture. Pauli Murray: Digiography explores the distance between primary source and secondary source, however small or large, thus providing an opportunity for herstorians to revise existing narratives and create new projects from the strength of the virtual repository.\n\nThe implications of this project are important for Digital Humanities (DH), historical studies, and African American Studies. For DH, this project presents a new form of thinking historically through the use of DH tools. It privileges non-linear, multi-site, storytelling as process, rather than as final product. It also joins the corpus of DH projects that focus on African Americans and activism. For History, this project will force historians to reconsider their methodologies, particularly in regard to the archive, biography, and movement history. Drawing on the insights of African American Studies, specifically the discipline’s critique of Western epistemologies, this project endeavors to chart a methodology for assembling life stories that reveals factors, events, and relationships overlooked in the process of writing herstory.\n\n\nAdditional Contributors\nCrystal Feimster’s Fall 2017 “Long Civil Rights Movement” class and student assistants: Annie Nields, Jaster Francis, Anna Milliken, Naiya Speight-Leggett, Henry Screen, Fiona Drenttel, Ayra Sundaram, Branson Rideaux, Lydia Horan, Lakshmi Amin, Ry Walker, Douglas Shao, Bianca Howell, Douglas Shao, Lionel Jin, Natalia Reyes Becerra, Anadee Mobaraki, Richard Mbouombouo, Valentina Guerrero, Max Schlenker, Katheryn Schmechel, Anushree Agrawal, Sasha Lee, Katharine Walls, Leah Smith, Elizabeth Spenst, Daniel Hamidi, Kellyn Kusyk, Elyse VanderWoude, Heeral McGhee.\n\n\nThis project has been generously supported by the Yale Digital Humanities Laboratory, a Yale DH Teaching Fellowship, and a Corpus Creation Seed Grant.\n",

It is built expressly for artists, audiences, critics, scholars, festival organizers, curators, and presenters from around the world. Performap also includes reports written by local writers and traveling reporters published by The Theatre Times.\n\nFestivals of theatre and performance are hotbeds of creativity, experimentation, cross-pollination, and virtuosity: they’re platforms for artists at the forefront of their fields. Because of the rapid timelines and compact scales of festival production, they’re also stunning snapshots of the field’s acutest aches, anxieties, and addictions.\n\nDesigned to drive online traffic to the individual festival websites, Performap is a highly visible and reliable node in the festival ecosystem—not a destination but a well-trodden intersection. At the same time, Performap also enables quantitative analysis of that very industry. Its primary purpose is to facilitate real-time access to festivals worldwide, ideally by increasing public awareness and ticket sales, but it also articulates the contours of festival circuitry through the collection and organization of measurable data. This data is open access, so that anyone has permission to use its digital archive, run quantitative analyses, and create visualizations, maps, and models of its contents. Performap is an invaluable resource for scholastic, journalistic, and management research on theatre and performance festivals worldwide.

Details are forthcoming.\n\nOverview\nThe mass digitization of visual collections from the libraries, galleries, and museums of Yale and the Smithsonian Institution has created unprecedented opportunities for discovery and interpretation. But the very scale of these digitized images has also introduced new challenges: existing methods of search are insufficient for the scale, and ill-suited for the characteristics, of these non-textual archives.\n\nPixPlot, an open-source web application from the Yale Digital Humanities Lab, leverages machine learning and advanced web programming to enable collection-scale analysis: the interactive exploration of archives that range in size from tens of thousands to a million images. Working at the intersection of computer vision, archival description, and scholarly annotation, PixPlot allows curators, scholars, and the public to pursue questions that involve the scope of an entire collection. Several teams from both Yale and the Smithsonian Institution are already using PixPlot for purposes as diverse as fashion photography from Vogue and a visual collection of fern leaves.\n\nThe April 2019 Machine Vision for Cultural Heritage and Natural Science Collections symposium showcased a variety of research applications for PixPlot and led to in-person brainstorming that centered the role of curators and scholars in driving future software development.\n\nBuilding on those conversations, Yale and the Smithsonian are partnering on two sets of hands-on workshops that will bring librarians, curators, and data science professionals together to explore their own collections in PixPlot. Participants will learn how to prepare, process, and visualize a collection of their choosing. No prior experience with programming is required, but participants will be asked to bring laptops with Chrome installed to the workshop.\n",

Inspired by Benoît Seguin et al.’s paper at DH Krakow (2016), PixPlot uses the penultimate layer of a pre-trained convolutional neural network for image captioning to derive a robost featurization space in 2,048 dimensions.\n\nInitial projects at Yale have used the software to visualize cultural heritage images held in the Beinecke Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library, Yale Center for British Art, and the Medical Historical Library.\n\nImproved Dimensionality Reduction\nIn order to collapse those 2,048 dimensions into something that can be rendered on a computer screen, we turned to Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP), a dimensionality reduction technique similar to t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) that seeks to preserve both local clusters and an interpretable global shape.\n\nDynamic Visualization\nTo visualize the results, we looked to approaches more commonly deployed in 3D game design. The resulting WebGL-powered visualization consists of a two-dimensional projection within which similar images cluster together. Users can navigate the space by panning and zooming in and out of clusters of interest, or they can jump to designated “hotspots” that feature a representative image from each cluster, as identified by the computer. There is also the possibility for users to curate their own hotspot clusters.\n\n\n\nSoftware Updates\nSince launching PixPlot in 2017, we have continued to implement new features that enhance the functionality and user experience of the software. These include adding:\n\n  new layout options, such as:\n    \n      rasterfairy (a grid view that facilitates viewing similar images all at once),\n      a date-based option that sorts images into temporal columns,\n    \n  \n  animations between layout views,\n  selecting and exporting tools,\n  IIIF integration,\n  single-vertex primitives to enable users to display lots of images.\n\n\nFuture Developments\nWe are currently working on additional enhancements to the software that include:\n\n  layouts based on user-provided metadata (such as geography),\n  basic search functionality,\n  improved shader performance,\n  enhanced sharing features,\n  text annotations within plots.\n\n\nFor more on the underlying code, visit the DHLab’s GitHub repository.

Through interaction with these visualizations, researchers can narrow the collection down to a subset of testimonies linked by common attribute values. In addition to identifying relevant testimonies, the visual search tool helps researchers better understand the shape and growth of the collection over time, as well as the demographic constitution of the survivors and witnesses who gave their testimony to the archive.\n\nThe visualization platform is meant to augment conventional catalog search tools, such as Yale’s Quick Search and the Fortunoff Archive’s primary discovery and access tool Aviary.

With the increasing support for digital scholarship on campus, scholars can now push these inquiries even further by incorporating digital methods to study literary, historical, cultural, and artistic data at new scales.\n\nThe newly renovated Franke Family Digital Humanities Laboratory (DHLab) is especially equipped to support such investigations. An open, communal workspace, the DHLab contains dual-boot computers with specialized software for text, image, network, and spatial analysis. High-definition monitors and an expanding Digital Humanities Reference Collection with books on theoretical and hands-on approaches to computational analysis line the room and are available for researchers to use.\n\nThe glass Special Projects Cube near the center of the lab contains equipment designed for high-performance humanities computing. Researchers who have been awarded a DHLab grant can request access to a machine in the Cube to work on their digital humanities project during the grant period.\n",
