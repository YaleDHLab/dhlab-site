The DHLab is equipped to support an array of computing needs. The Special Projects Cube at the center of the DHLab contains reservable scanning equipment for digitization and machines with specialized software for text, image, network, and spatial analysis and for general machine learning research. An open, communal workspace, the former reading room is lined with high-definition monitors, iMacs, and PCs, as well as an expanding Digital Humanities Book Collection available for researchers to use.  

Please [schedule a consultation](https://schedule.yale.edu/appointments/dhlab) with DHLab staff about using the equipment in the cube before [placing a reservation in LibCal](https://schedule.yale.edu/spaces?lid=9064).
