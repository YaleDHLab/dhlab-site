The Yale Digital Humanities Lab leads workshops throughout the year on methods and tools related to data collection, cleaning, mining, visualization, and analysis. These workshops are open to all Yale students, faculty, and staff, but sometimes space is limited, so please check to see if registration is required.

Couldn't make a workshop? Most of our tutorials are posted to the DHLab's <a href='https://github.com/YaleDHLab/lab-workshops' target='_blank'>GitHub Repository</a>.
