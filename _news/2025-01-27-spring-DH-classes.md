**Columbus to Google: A Critical History of the Archive**  
CPLT 567, EMST 825, SPAN 754  
Ayesha Ramachandran and Alexander Gil Fuentes  
  
Modern libraries and archives cannot be understood without reference to the history of European conquest and colonial expansion. Scholars today train to read between the lines, against the grain, to mind the gaps, and even to critically fabulate in order to reconstruct the lived world and knowledge lost in the wake of European genocide and erasure. This course revisits key episodes, tropes, ideas, and practices from the past 500 years to investigate how the de facto archive of humanity came to be the way it is today. Students will examine the history of archives from the time of Columbus to the present, when generative AI has begun to make hallucinatory contributions to the human record and companies like Google, Microsoft, OpenAI, and Clarivate have gained enormous power through their ability to manipulate corpora.
