The Digital Humanities Lab (DHLab) is excited to share that Monica Ong Reed has joined on as our User Experience Designer. An M.F.A. graduate in Digital Media from the Rhode Island School of Design, she first came to Yale as designer for the School of Music (2007-2015) to lead initiatives in web and mobile publishing. Her design for the YSM website was nominated for a Webby Award in 2014 and recognized by the W3 Awards and the Connecticut Art Director’s Club.
   
Monica is coming to the DHLab from the Yale School of Music, where she created the user interface for the Yale Collection of Musical Instruments’ online catalog, providing a framework for multi-media discovery experiences. Monica will be instrumental in designing the visual appearance and user experience of rich-client, web-based projects coming out of the Lab.
   
Monica will be working in the DHLab (Sterling Memorial Library, 316). Please stop by to welcome her!
