The Yale Public Humanities Working Group visited the DHLab on October 13 to tour the space and discuss productive crossovers in digital humanities and public humanities initiatives. DHLab Director, [Peter Leonard](http://resources.library.yale.edu/StaffDirectory/detail.aspx?q=718), began the discussion by introducing the Lab, and [Lindsay King](http://resources.library.yale.edu/StaffDirectory/detail.aspx?q=631) (Robert B. Haas Family Arts Library), [Lisa Conathan](http://resources.library.yale.edu/StaffDirectory/detail.aspx?q=107) Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library), and [Catherine DeRose](http://resources.library.yale.edu/StaffDirectory/detail.aspx?q=806) (Digital Humanities Lab) each highlighted example crossover projects.

Lindsay demoed [Ensemble](http://web.library.yale.edu/dhlab/ensemble), a crowdsourcing effort for Yale playbills that is modeled after the New York Public Library's [What's on the Menu?](http://menus.nypl.org/), Lisa presented on a Cherokee Transcription project that works with a collection held in Beinecke Library, and Catherine provided an overview of Carnegie Hall's [Lullaby Project](http://www.carnegiehall.org/Lullaby/), which pairs mothers and musicians together. The conversation continued informally after the presentations, as people interacted with the space and tried out additional Lab projects.
