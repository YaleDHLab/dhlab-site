The Yale Digital Humanities Lab (DHLab) is happy to announce that Gavi Levy Haskell has joined us as our new Digital Humanities Developer. Gavi has worked on digital humanities projects for about a decade, ranging from 3D modeling to curriculum development to mapping; most recently, they served as the Technology Fellow at the Harvard Art Museums, where they generated visualizations of the collection’s data and collaborated on digital projects with faculty, students, and staff. They also are a Ph.D. candidate in Yale’s History of Art Department, where they are finishing their dissertation on visual narrative. Before coming to Yale, Gavi earned a B.A. from Smith College in art history and computer science and an M.A. from the Courtauld Institute of Art in the history of art.   

Please join us in welcoming Gavi! You can find their office (SML 176F) in the DHLab, or email them at [gavi.levyhaskell@yale.edu](mailto:gavi.levyhaskell@yale.edu).
