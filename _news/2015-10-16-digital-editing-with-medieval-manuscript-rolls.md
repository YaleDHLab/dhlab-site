[The Yale Working Group in Digital Manuscript Studies](http://whc.yale.edu/digital-manuscript-studies) and the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library are pleased to announce a call for expressions of interest in the Fall 2015 Digital Manuscript Studies Workshop.

Participants will learn the fundamentals of digital editing while tackling the unique codicological challenges posed by manuscript rolls. Practical sessions will inform collective editorial decision-making; participants will undertake the work of transcription and commentary, and tag the text and images of this hitherto unedited roll according to TEI protocols. The workshop will result in a collaborative edition of Takamiya MS 35, which will be published on the Beinecke Library website. No prior paleography or digitization experience is required.

If you're interested in securing a place, or for more information, please email [anya.adair@yale.edu](mailto:anya.adair@yale.edu). The workshop will be limited to 12 spots; preference will be given to Yale graduate students. Further details and full registration information will be available in late October. We look forward to hearing from you.
