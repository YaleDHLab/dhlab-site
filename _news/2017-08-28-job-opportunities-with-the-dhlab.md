If you have programming skills and an interest in humanistic data, apply to work in the Digital Humanities Lab! We are looking to hire Yale undergraduate and graduate students to work on a variety of exciting projects that are underway in the lab.

**Call for Digital Humanities Lab Assistants**

Every semester the Digital Humanities Lab funds projects that require different levels of programming expertise. If you would like to be considered for one of these positions when they open up, please email your resume/CV to [dhlab@yale.edu](mailto:dhlab@yale.edu).

**Call for Digital Scholarship Services Graduate Student Consultants**
*Priority Application Window Closes: Thursday, September 14th*
*Application Window Closes: Thursday, September 28th*

Yale Digital Scholarship Services (part of the Yale University Library) is looking for graduate students to join our team as Digital Scholarship consultants.

Whether you use field surveys to predict the outbreak of civil war, machine learning to find aesthetic patterns in 18th-century paintings, interactive data visualizations to track instances of textual reuse in Classical literature, or big data technologies to identify systemic drivers of gene expression, we want to hear from you. Your data might come from surveys, text, assays, pixels, networks, experiments, simulations, or audio recordings â€” we are looking for team members who work with any of it.

Digital Scholarship consultants work with the DHLab (dhlab.yale.edu) and the StatLab (yale.edu/statlab) to provide support for disciplines across the Yale University community. The DHLab offers consultations, workshops, and grants to support scholars using computational methods to pursue humanistic inquiries. The StatLab provides support for quantitative analysis through instruction, consultation, and collaboration. Digital Scholarship consultants have the option to work with either group or both, depending on their interests and experience.

**Eligibility**

We are looking for PhD students who:

 * have completed most of their humanities, statistics, geospatial statistics, or data analysis related coursework
 * can comfortably operate as one of our experts providing instruction, consultation, and project collaboration
 * are skilled in appropriate software and have the necessary computing knowledge to help others
 * can commit to at least four hours each week during the semester (there is ample opportunity to work more)
 * are interested in developing instructional materials and training workshops for support of digital, data, and methodological literacy in the Yale community

**Responsibilities**

Specific duties can vary, but you should expect:

 * to meet with Yale community members from the undergraduate level to the faculty level and to provide guidance on research questions in a 1-on-1 setting
 * to use your proficiency in digital humanities, statistics, geospatial statistics, or data analysis topics
 * to answer common questions across various disciplines
 * to use your expertise on specific digital humanities, statistics, geospatial statistics, or data analysis topics, and to act as a point person for related questions
 * to think on your feet, quickly assess the needs of patrons, and help develop a recommendation for how they should proceed given their subject area, background, and timeline
 * to hone your teaching skills by developing and leading workshops on specific software applied to digital humanities, statistics, geospatial statistics, and data analysis topics

**What do our consultants get?**

We pay our graduate students an hourly rate competitive with teaching fellowships and more than other university jobs. In addition to time spent providing 1-on-1 support, we pay our consultants to develop and teach workshops, attend other workshops to sharpen their own skills, and work with faculty and librarians on projects.

Beyond this, our consultants report that answering questions and problem-solving with our clients helps them retain and sharpen their own skills. Working with researchers from other disciplines can lead to interesting and collaborative experiences that may extend beyond the consulting team's work.

**Want to apply?**

If you are interested in joining one of the teams, please send an email of intent to [digitalscholarship.services@yale.edu](mailto:digitalscholarship.services@yale.edu).

This email should include a brief description of your background, the reasons you would be a good addition to the team, and a current CV (PDF format) as an attachment. We'll be in touch and move the process forward from there.

Please send your email of intent by Thursday, September 28th for consideration. To receive priority consideration, we recommend submitting the email of intent prior to Thursday, September 14th. The interview and hiring process is rolling and will start for candidates as materials are received beginning September 14th.
