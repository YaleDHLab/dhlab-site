The Digital Humanities Lab (DHLab) is excited to share that [Carol Chiodo](http://carolchiodo.com/) has joined on as one of our Postdoctoral Associates. Carol is a writer, scholar, and educator whose work investigates how the material and structural changes in the reproduction, storage, and transmission of texts impact the ways we read, write, and learn. She received a PhD in Italian Language and Literature from Yale with a dissertation on medieval vernacular poetry and the mechanical arts. Her current research uses social network analysis to explore the membership rolls of early scholarly societies in North America as a source for women's history.

Carol will be working in the DHLab (Sterling Memorial Library, 316). Please stop by to welcome her!
