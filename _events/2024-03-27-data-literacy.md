### Overview
Curious about when or how to introduce data to your research? Want help choosing the right data for your question? Not sure what “data” even means in the humanities? This workshop will introduce you to some key vocabularies and resources for getting started with data work, assist you in framing a data-answerable research question, and guide you in finding and using an appropriate dataset to answer it. Open to graduate and undergraduate students in any discipline, but most useful to data newcomers. No programming experience required.
