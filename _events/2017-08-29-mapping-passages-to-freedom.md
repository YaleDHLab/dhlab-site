Join us for a special Office Hours this Tuesday to hear outgoing DHLab Postdoc Jonathan Schroeder discuss his project, "Passages to Freedom: Worlding the North American Slave Narrative." This project uses data from the University of North Carolina's North American Slave Narrative corpus to map routes taken by the authors of the 103 extant autobiographical African-American slave narratives published before emancipation in 1863. Jonathan will present on the composition of the project in its current iteration, as well as future plans.
