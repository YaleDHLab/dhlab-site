### Overview
Are you curious about Yale’s theater history? Are you a speedy typist? Do you love looking at old ads? If the answer is yes, join us for one—or both—of the <a href='http://ensemble.yale.edu/#/' target='_blank'>Ensemble@Yale</a> Transcribe-a-thons!

Drop in anytime to contribute to the project, enjoy snacks, and play Ensemble@Yale bingo! Help the Yale Digital Humanities Laboratory and Haas Arts Library collect actor and staff names from over 900 Yale School of Drama and Yale Repertory Theatre programs. 

**Please bring a computer with you to the trascribe-a-thon. If you would like to participate but don’t have a laptop, please contact the <a href="mailto:dhlab@yale.edu">event organizers</a> in advance to see if arrangements can be made.**
