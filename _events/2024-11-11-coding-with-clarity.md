  Web scraping in Python? Crunching numbers in R? Make sure you (and others!) can understand and reuse your code! This workshop will teach you some language-agnostic best practices for coding, including writing effective documentation, producing readable code, working towards modular programming, and choosing appropriate data structures.

### Overview
Interested in using AI to write code? Tried it out already and not getting the results you want? Join us for this interactive session to learn strategies for coding with Clarity! We’ll talk about how to break up tasks into defined, testable chunks; how to debug code and identify problems; and how to describe the work you’ve done for yourself and others. Come prepared to discuss and try out examples—walk away with strategies for producing code more easily and more legibly, with or without an AI assist.  

*Note:* This workshop will use Python for its examples. No prior experience with Python or Clarity is required, but some exposure to coding may help you follow along.
