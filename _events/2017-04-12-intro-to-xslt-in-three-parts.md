This workshop will provide a basic overview of XSLT as a declarative programming language. The instructor will demonstrate an iterative process of investigating, updating, and reviewing a TEI file with the assistance of XSLT. Every participant will gain hands-on experience transforming an XML document with the oXygen XML Editor, using a supplied XSLT stylesheet, and writing a very simple XSLT stylesheet from scratch. The workshop will conclude with a couple of different methods for publishing TEI online.

No prior encoding experience is required but basic knowledge of XML will be helpful. Participants are encouraged to install the <a href='https://www.oxygenxml.com/xml_editor/register.html#get_trial' target='_blank'>oXygen XML Editor</a> prior to the workshop in order to follow along with the exercises.

The workshop is open to all Yale students, faculty, and staff; no registration is required.

*This workshop is co-organized by the Classics Library, the YUL Department of Areas Studies and Humanities Research Support, the Yale Digital Propertius Project, and the Yale Digital Humanities Lab.*
