  What can machine vision techniques help us discover in photographic archives? How might the code we write contribute to society? What do literature and physics have in common? For these questions and many more, join us for the fourth annual Beyond Boundaries symposium, a half-day event organized around hybrid scholarship at Yale.

What can machine vision techniques help us discover in photographic archives? How might the code we write contribute to society? What do literature and physics have in common? To answer these questions and many more, join us for the fourth annual Beyond Boundaries, a half-day symposium organized around hybrid scholarship at Yale.

Beyond Boundaries will be hosted in the newly renovated Franke Family Digital Humanities Lab and will feature the work of Yale undergraduates, graduate students, faculty, postdoctoral associates, and staff on topics ranging from computer-generated
models and text mining to maps and interactive visual representations of data.
