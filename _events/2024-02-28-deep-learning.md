### Overview
Explore the possibilities and ethical pitfalls of using artificial intelligence methods for humanities research in this interactive, two-part virtual workshop, led by Nicole Cosmé-Clifford.  
  
In the last year, artificial intelligence technologies have skyrocketed in popularity. Many fall under the heading “deep learning,” a kind of artificial intelligence in which computers learn to extract statistical patterns from large collections of data. Perhaps the most jarring aspect of recent deep AI technology is not its unparalleled number-crunching abilities but the fact that it acts on human cultural artifacts—for example, ChatGPT acts on text, while Midjourney and DALL-E act on images. This is a continuing source of both intrigue and unease for academics, as deep AI is bound to both pioneering research and pressing ethical concerns. This workshop series engages both sentiments. Part I will sketch the current landscape of deep learning in digital humanities research, identifying major research questions, methodologies, and conclusions. Part II considers the problems in using deep learning to explore human-made works of art, ethical practices in deep learning for digital humanities research, and knowledge gaps in AI ethics.  
  
*Note:* This workshop series will involve a lot of working together, but we do not expect participants to bring existing knowledge of DH methods, programming, or technical skills in general. The series is open to current Yale graduate students, postdocs, faculty, and staff.
