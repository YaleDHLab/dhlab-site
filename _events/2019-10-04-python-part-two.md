### Overview

This second workshop in the Python for Humanists series introduces more complex programming concepts that will be useful when working with data. We will focus on: 
- using loops for repetitive tasks
- using conditional logic
- beginning to work with data.

Designed for participants who have taken <a href='{{site.baseurl}}/events/2019-09-06-intro-python.html' target='_blank'>Python for Humanists</a>, Part I or who have comparable minimal programming experience, this workshop will serve as a foundation for upcoming DHLab workshops on text and data mining.

Instructor: Joshua Dull (DHLab)

### Registration
This workshop is open to all Yale students, faculty, and staff, but space is limited. To register, visit the <a href='https://schedule.yale.edu/event/5807804' target='_blank'>YUL Instruction Calendar</a>. 

**Participants are required to bring a laptop with <a href='https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/' target='_blank'>Anaconda 3.7</a> already installed to the workshop.** If you have trouble with the installation, stop by the Digital Humanities Lab's Office Hours, Monday through Thursday at 3:00 p.m. for help.
