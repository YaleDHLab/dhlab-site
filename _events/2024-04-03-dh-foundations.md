  Learn what it means to "do DH"—especially what it means to "do good DH"—in this interactive online workshop series. Over the course of three sessions, participants will explore avenues for creating meaningful and ethical DH projects, examine the history of DH as a field, and critically discuss case studies as a group.

### Overview
In this interactive workshop series, participants will explore many avenues for creating meaningful and ethical DH projects by critically discussing case studies of existing projects as a group. We’ll also discuss the history of DH as a field and practice while collaboratively creating vocabularies around what it even means to “do DH”— especially what it means to “do good DH”—and identifying important questions to ask along the way.  
  
Participants will work together to identify qualities essential to any effective DH project and will walk away with a shared vocabulary to critique and propose DH projects of their own. This workshop will involve a lot of working together, but we do not expect participants to bring existing knowledge of DH methods, programming, or technical skills in general.  
  
*Note:* This workshop series is open to current Yale graduate students and postdocs and is the first requirement to complete the Digital Humanities Lab’s DH certificate. Participants must attend all three sessions to receive credit.
