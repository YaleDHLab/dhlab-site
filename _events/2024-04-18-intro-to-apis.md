### Workshop Overview
Wishing you could just tap into existing sources of structured data? Contemplating a project with data provided through an API? Wondering what an API is and how to use it?  

Join us to learn more about the typical structures of data-focused APIs, pick up some new terminology, and practice using an API to obtain data! We’ll also cover strategies for working with more difficult or unusual APIs.  

*Technical Requirements:* Please download <a href='https://openrefine.org/' target='_blank'>OpenRefine</a> in advance of this workshop. No programming experience is needed, but some willingness to code will help you make the most of APIs.
