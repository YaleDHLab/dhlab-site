Join us for a special Office Hours in which former DHLab Postdoc Gideon Fink Shapiro presents his research on the architecture of Yale’s new residential college in the context of campus and New Haven history, building techniques, and environmental processes. The project uses data from historic map collections, the James Gamble Rogers Papers, and the architects and builders of Yale’s new Benjamin Franklin and Pauli Murray Colleges. Gideon will present the current iteration of the project as well as plans for its continued development.

All are welcome! Coffee will be available.
