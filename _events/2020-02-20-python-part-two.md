### Overview

This second workshop in the Python for Humanists series introduces more complex programming concepts that will be useful when working with data. We will focus on: 
- using loops for repetitive tasks
- using conditional logic
- beginning to work with data.

Designed for participants who have taken <a href='{{site.baseurl}}/events/2019-09-06-intro-python.html' target='_blank'>Python for Humanists</a>, Part I or who have comparable minimal programming experience, this workshop will serve as a foundation for upcoming DHLab workshops on text and data mining.

Instructor: Joshua Dull (DHLab)

### Registration & Requirements
This workshop is open to all Yale students, faculty, and staff, but space is limited. To register, visit the <a href='https://schedule.yale.edu/event/6305306' target='_blank'>YUL Instruction Calendar</a>. 

**Participants are required to bring a laptop with <a href='https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/' target='_blank'>Anaconda Python 3.7</a> already installed to the workshop.** If you have trouble with the installation, stop by the Digital Humanities Lab's Office Hours, Monday through Thursday at 3:00 p.m. for help.

### Follow-Up Information
Participants are invited to attend the Python Working Group, which meets every Friday from 3:00-4:00 p.m. At the working group, you can ask additional Python questions, pick an online tutorial to try from our curated list, and meet other researchers learning the language.

*Be among the first to know when future workshops are announced by signing up for the <a href='https://subscribe.yale.edu/browse?search=digital+humanities' target='_blank'>DHLab's newsletter</a>.*
