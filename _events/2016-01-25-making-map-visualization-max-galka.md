YaleMakes and Yale Data Science are pleased to announce that Max Galka will lead a hands-on workshop covering the essentials of GIS (geographic information systems). He will walk through the process of obtaining and using public data to create thematic maps. The workshop will take place on Saturday, January 30 from 1:30-2:30pm in BassL70.

Galka's [data-driven graphics](http://metrocosm.com) have been featured in *The Washington Post*, *Time*, *The Guardian*, and *Huffington Post*. He publishes data visualizations with the aim of provoking thought, and he enjoys teaching people how to do the same.

No programming experience is required, but it is recommended that you bring a laptop.
