How can virtual reality technologies help us understand poetry? What does music reveal about the brain? The Yale Digital Humanities Lab and STEAM are excited to open submissions for this year’s Beyond Boundaries: An Annual Symposium on Hybrid Scholarship at Yale, which will take place on Friday, April 6. We welcome submissions from any projects that combine humanistic and scientific approaches. 

### Invitation to Present your Work
Beyond Boundaries features the work of Yale undergraduates, graduate students, faculty, and staff on topics ranging from computer-generated models and data mining to maps of literary characters over the course of a novel. If you are interested in presenting a poster or giving a 7-minute lightning talk at the event, please submit <a href='https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeTuMU5uVcURVlvH9BXrCtiIN5jfitKBxSRVtZPslQpOzHQzQ/viewform' target='_blank'>a short online application</a> by February 19. Poster presenters will have the option to show their work on a computer. Undergraduates, graduate students, postdoctoral associates, faculty, and staff are encouraged to apply.
