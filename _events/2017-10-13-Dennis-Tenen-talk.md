Dennis Tenen, Assistant Professor at Columbia University, is a digital humanities scholar, literary critic, and author of Plain Text: The Poetics of Computation (Stanford UP). In addition to his vast research on the histories of reading and media, computational narratology, philosophy and poetics of computing, and literary theory, he is also the founder of Columbia’s Group for Experimental Methods in the Humanities, in which literary scholars from a broad range of specializations and departments at the university gather to work on digital methods.

All are welcome to attend his talk, "Towards a Computational Archaeology of Fictional Space." Refreshments will be served.
