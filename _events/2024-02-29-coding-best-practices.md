### Overview
Web scraping in Python? Crunching numbers in R? Make sure you (and others!) can understand and reuse your code! In this workshop, we’ll cover some language-agnostic best practices for coding, including writing effective documentation, producing readable code, working towards modular programming, and choosing appropriate data structures. Previous exposure to a programming language such as Python, Java, MATLAB, or R may be helpful, but it is not required.
