### Overview
Struggling to express a pattern you’re noticing in your data? Just looking to add visual interest to your DH project? Try a data visualization! This workshop will expose you to principles and techniques for making compelling data visualizations that effectively convey your work to viewers. Participants will walk away with a conceptual grounding in designing data visualizations; this workshop will not focus on conveying statistical significance or adhering to disciplinary standards in traditional data fields. No programming experience required.
