  Learn what it means to "do DH"—especially what it means to "do *good* DH"—in this online workshop series for Yale graduate students and postdocs. Through group discussions of DH case studies, we will explore avenues for creating meaningful and ethical projects, and we will identify important questions to ask along the way.
---

### Overview
In this interactive, three-part workshop series, participants will explore many avenues for creating meaningful and ethical DH projects by critically discussing case studies of existing projects as a group. We’ll also discuss the history of DH as a field and practice while collaboratively creating vocabularies around what it even means to “do DH”— especially what it means to “do good DH” —and identifying important questions to ask along the way.  

Participants will work together to identify qualities essential to any effective DH project and will walk away with a shared vocabulary to critique and propose DH projects of their own. This workshop will involve a lot of working together, but we do not expect participants to bring existing knowledge of DH methods, programming, or technical skills in general.  

<em>Note:</em> This workshop is open to current Yale graduate students and postdocs and is the first requirement to complete the Digital Humanities Lab’s DH certificate (offered starting in Fall 2023). Participants must attend all three parts to receive credit.
