This workshop will introduce attendees to the <a href='https://d3js.org/' target='_blank'>D3.js data visualization framework</a>. We will discuss the core building blocks of D3.js visualizations, including scales, SVG elements, selections, and data updates. D3.js is a complex framework to learn. The goals for this workshop are to expose participants to the underlying vocabulary and functionality.

Participants who are unfamiliar with JavaScript are strongly encouraged to follow the tutorial from our <a href='https://github.com/YaleDHLab/lab-workshops/blob/master/intro-to-javascript/README.md' target='_blank'>Intro to JavaScript workshop</a> prior to the D3 session.

Registration is open to all Yale students, faculty, and staff, but space is limited. To register, please visit the <a href='http://schedule.yale.edu/event/3702067' target='_blank'>YUL Instruction Calendar</a>.

Instructor: Douglas Duhaime (DHLab)
