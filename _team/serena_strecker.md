Serena Strecker is a Ph.D. candidate in the History Department, specializing in the history of religion, media, and communication in early modern Europe. Her dissertation examines collections of exempla, short stories meant to illustrate a moral or doctrinal message, to uncover the interconnections between Catholic and Lutheran discourse during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. In the digital humanities, Serena has worked on developing a set of best practices for applying handwritten text recognition (HTR) to early modern print and using network analysis to visualize the early modern media ecosystem.
