Carson Koepke is a PhD candidate in the Medieval Studies Program. His research interests broadly include medieval narrative poetry, hagiography, manuscript studies, and literary exchanges between the Byzantine Empire, Italy, the Carolingian Empire, and Early England. He applies digital methodologies, including GIS mapping and complex network analysis, to his research on the circulation of saints’ lives. In his dissertation, he uses the popular and widespread legend of St. Eustace Placidas to examine the myriad ways that Christian saints’ lives responded to early medieval literary and intellectual culture in the wider Mediterranean region and Europe.
