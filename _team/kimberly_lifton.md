Kimberly Lifton is a PhD student in the Medieval Studies Program. She holds a BA from Hamilton College and an MPhil from the University of Cambridge. Her dissertation research considers how knowledge of changing geopolitics in the Islamic world during the fifteenth century reached England, Burgundy, and France. The dissertation project draws together political documents, art, and literature to expose the influence of knowledge collection on fictional representations of Muslims. In the digital humanities, Kimberly has worked on several projects involving handwritten text recognition and natural language processing.
