### Enriching Exhibition Scholarship: Reconciling Knowledge Graphs and Social Media from Newspaper Articles to Twitter

As art and cultural heritage objects circulate among museum exhibitions, they spark a wide array of written responses: museum catalogs, gallery labels, social media posts, reviews in magazines and newspapers, and more. Such texts offer invaluable insight into the reception of these objects, revealing how critics and members of the public have viewed them over time and in different contexts. At present, however, we lack a means of accessing all of this information in one place.  

Led by researchers from Yale, the University of Edinburgh, and Oxford University's e-Research Centre and Ashmolean Museum of Art and Archaeology, *Enriching Exhibition Scholarship* aims to consolidate and share this wealth of exhibition data. In addition to collecting relevant material through text mining and machine learning, the project team will structure this data using a model created by the <a href='https://linked.art/' target='_blank'>Linked Art community</a>, and reconcile it to the metadata systems used by museum around the globe. By making this data more accessible to researchers and museum-goers, *Enriching Exhibition Scholarship* hopes to illuminate how art and cultural heritage objects travel, and to facilitate future work on exhibition trends and reception patterns.
