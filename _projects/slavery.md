<h2 class='subheading'>Overview</h2>

<p>The Yale Slavery and Abolition Portal (link is external) is designed to help researchers and students find primary sources related to slavery, abolition, and resistance within Yale University’s many libraries and galleries.</p>

<p>Developed in cooperation with the Gilder Lehrman Center for the Study of Slavery, Resistance, and Abolition , this portal shares the Center’s interest in the global history of slavery and its legacies, broadly defined. Items featured on the portal are not confined to the United States or the Atlantic world or the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, even if these places and periods tend to form the focus of the sources included.</p>
