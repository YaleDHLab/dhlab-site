### Overview

Few magazines can boast being continuously published for over a century, familiar and interesting to wide audiences, full of iconic pictures, and also completely digitized and marked up as both text and images. *Robots Reading Vogue* demonstrates the possible forms humanistic research can take when you have 2,700 covers, 400,000 pages, and 6 TB of data. Experiments include topic models, N-gram searches, and colormetric analysis.
