The DHLab provides competitive access to mini-grants of $500 each academic semester to support the development of graduate-level digital projects asking humanistic questions.  
  
One of the most common challenges to digital humanities research at the graduate level is the gap between what traditional research funding can support and what innovative digital research practically requires. These mini-grants are intended to fund practical project purchases that cannot easily be funded or obtained otherwise.  
  
*Note that the spring application cycle (closing March 31st) is for fall participation and fund disbursement, and the fall application cycle (closing October 31st) is for spring participation and fund disbursement. Awardees will attend virtual monthly meetings in the semester in which they receive funds and will present their research at a public work-in-progress presentation in the semester following. Priority will be given to applicants whose digital projects are a significant component of their degree completion, such as a dissertation or masterâ€™s thesis.*
