The DHLab welcomes graduate students to complete our Digital Humanities Certificate, starting in fall 2023. After attending our DH Foundations workshop, certificate students will consult with DHLab staff to choose a total of six experiences (satisfied through a personalized combination of coursework, training, and/or project work) in order to demonstrate digital humanities competencies across four possible themes: DH methodologies (text mining, digitization, etc.), equity (accessibility, community engagement, etc.), digital materialities (digital media, archives, etc.), and job functions (project management, technical writing, etc.).
