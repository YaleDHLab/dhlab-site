John Williams, Kim worked with the DHLab to develop a number of digital projects for a course entitled "Countercultures." This course explored a number of states of "altered consciousness" throughout the 1960s and 1970s, offering a more nuanced exploration of what it meant to cultivate an experience that ran "counter" to the dominant practices of American bourgeois society. Students learned how to use network visualization tools, topic mapping, and trend visualization software — as well as a few digital tools by which they can create their own countercultural projects — to better understand the relationship between what runs against mainstream culture, and the mainstream culture that has a tendency to absorb it. Fall 2016 </span></div><div class='person'> <b>Carlotta Chenoweth</b>, <span class='dept'>Slavic Languages and Literatures</span>. <span>As a Digital Humanities Fellow, Carlotta worked closely with students in a new course, “Avant-Gardes and Émigrés: Digital Humanities Lab,” with Professor Marijeta Bozovic.

This project entails the development of a hybrid curated and user-generated digital archive of live performance that works towards a responsive and dynamic model of performance archives—one that documents performers and performances and attends to the central role of audiences in sustaining grassroots trans- feminist and queer cultures. The Cabaret Commons project has been generously supported by the Canadian Writing Research Collaboratory (CWRC) and the Social Sciences and Humanities Council of Canada (SSHRC). T.L. is also a practicing performance and video artist and co-founder and co-editor of the Helix Critical Project. 2015-2016 </span></div><div class='person'> <b>Lauren Tilton</b>, <span class='dept'>American Studies</span>. <span>As a Fellow for the Mellon advanced seminar "(En)visualizing Knowledge: Text Mining, Mapping, Network Analysis, and Big Data," taught by Professors Laura Wexler and Inderpal Grewal, Lauren worked with the DHLab to teach graduate students a variety of DH approaches to text mining, mapping, network analysis, and data visualization.
