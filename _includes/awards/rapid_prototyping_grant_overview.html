  <p>The grants are structured around three one-week engagements between Digital Humanities Lab staff and the recipient(s) that focus on one of the following phases of a project: requirements drafting, design, and development. 

  <p><strong>Requirements Document</strong> This stage is all about articulating and confirming the deliverable that will be built. During this stage, the recipient commits to meeting with the Lab team once at the beginning of the week to review the Lean Canvas and Ideation forms that accompanied the application. A second meeting will be required at the end of the week to sign off on a wireframe that will depict the requirements of the project. The recipient's signature is required before work will advance.</p>  

  <p><strong>Design</strong> During the design phase, the Lab will iterate on different views of the application based on the signed wireframe. The recipient commits to meeting once during the middle of the week to review mockups and select one finalized mockup to be implemented.</p>  

  <p><strong>Development</strong> In this final phase, the Lab will build the deliverable based on the design from week two. The recipient commits to meeting once during the middle of the week for an update on the work and to consult on any questions that have arisen.</p>

  <p>By the end of the grant, recipients will have both the agreed-upon project feature and also experience with the production workflow that underlies many digital humanities projects.</p>
