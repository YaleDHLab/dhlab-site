This multidisciplinary seminar studies platforms as hybrids of firms and multi-sided markets with unique governance and infrastructures. Through case studies from around the world, the class examines how platforms have transformed connectivity, labor, creativity, and democracy. It also considers how contemporary capitalism and digital economies intersect with topics such as inequality, surveillance, decentralization, and cooperation.<br/> <br/></p><p><strong>Digital War</strong><br/> AMST 269 / ER&amp;M 330 / SAST 262<br/> Madiha Tahir</p><p>From drones and autonomous robots to algorithmic warfare, virtual war gaming, and data mining, digital war has become a key issue of our times. Not only has warfare been shaped by digital technologies; technologies such as GPS, stealth technology, personal computing, and the Internet also have been conditioned through modern conflict. This class provides a critical overview of the links between war and technology. Drawing on visual media, fiction, art, and scholarly texts, students will examine digital war’s connections to colonialism and imperialism, as well as its effects on those targeted.<br/> <br/></p><p><strong>Spatial Analysis for Archaeology</strong><br/> ANTH 476 / ARCG 476<br/> William Honeychurch</p><p>This class offers an introduction to the use of geographical information systems (GIS) in anthropology, with particular attention to GIS applications in archaeology.

Using the archaeological artifacts in the <a href="https://babylonian-collection.yale.edu/" target="_blank">Yale Babylonian Collection</a> as case studies, students will learn how new computer graphics technologies—including 3D imaging—can be used to document and interpret archaeological artifacts. The course also will explore how these imaging techniques can support archaeological and anthropological research more generally.<br/> <br/></p><p><strong>Cultural AI: Machine Vision, Art, and Design</strong><br/> ARCH 332<br/> Brennan Buck</p><p>Artificial intelligence (AI) promises to transform art and design, both by replacing human labor and by altering and displacing human creativity. This course seeks to understand this new machine-mediated visual culture, find opportunities for intervention, and identify avenues for critique and resistance. Topics will include the historical role of algorithms; the idea of creation and design as an algorithmic, even machinic, process; and the shift to the black box of machine learning and the birth of “cultural AI.” Students additionally will use AI platforms such as Runway ML to develop their own design proposals.<br/> <br/></p><p><strong>Rendered: Art, Architecture, and Contemporary Image Culture</strong><br/> ARCH 1241<br/> Brennan Buck</p><p>This course examines digital production and image making in art and architecture at a time when consumers of culture, including architects, are inundated by digital images. In addition to considering the current and future role of the image as an architectural medium, the class will study the Internet’s impact on contemporary art; recent writing on aesthetic concepts, including post-digital, post-medium, and the new aesthetic; and the effect of contemporary image culture on authorship, materiality, and representation. Students also will produce a hybrid image-object situated in both a physical and an online context.</p><p><em>Note:</em> This class will open for registration on Jan. 12. Yale College students must request permission to register using the <a href="https://registrar.yale.edu/forms-petitions" target="blank">“Request to Enroll in a Professional School Course” form (“Blue Form”)</a>.
