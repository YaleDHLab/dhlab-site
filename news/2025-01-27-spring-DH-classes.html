This course aims to help students of all disciplines learn some of the basic limits of AI, understand how to critically analyze public claims made about it, and understand its societal impact. Topics will include job loss due to automation, how machine learning systems are impacting healthcare, the impact of language models like ChatGPT on education, and many other issues at the front of the headlines today. Prior experience with AI and programming is not required.<br/> <br/></p><p><strong>Decentering Computer Science: Transpacific Computing History across U.S., East Asia, and Beyond</strong><br/> CPSC 190, EAST 201<br/> Yoehan Oh</p><p>This seminar examines how transpacific relations between China, Taiwan, and the U.S. have shaped the history of computer science, transcending simple “friend or foe” rivalries. Topics include China-born first-generation digital computer pioneers, the digitization of Asian characters, the development of transpacific computer and labor networks, transpacific work to build CS fundamentals, exclusionism, trade protectionism, and “friendshoring” across the Asia-Pacific region.<br/> <br/></p><p><strong>Telling Stories With Maps: From Ancient Times to the <em>New York Times</em></strong><br/> CSGH 220<br/> Aaron Reiss</p><p>From ancient mariners’ projections of what exists beyond the known world to high-tech visual journalism in modern war zones, maps have been used to construct narratives, make arguments, and find sense in the abstract. In this class, students will investigate the narrative possibilities of cartography through academic texts, investigative visual journalism, close readings of maps, and making maps of their own. By employing the cartographic and narrative strategies studied in class, students become visual journalists and digital storytellers in their own right.<br/> <br/></p><p><strong>Culture as Data: Thinking Computationally with Text</strong><br/> ENGL 2021, HUMS 321, LITR 325<br/> Sayan Bhattacharyya</p><p>This course investigates the field of digital humanities and its limitations, focusing specifically on textual analysis. Through a combination of readings and hands-on tinkering, the class will investigate computational techniques such as vector semantics, topic modeling, and commonly used frameworks and toolkits for machine learning with text. Prior programming knowledge is not required.<br/> <br/></p><p><strong>Geographic Information Systems</strong><br/> EVST 290, URBN 319<br/> Jill Kelly</p><p>This class offers a practical introduction to the nature and use of geographic information systems (GIS) in environmental science and management. Over the course of the semester, students will explore techniques for the acquisition, creation, storage, management, visualization, animation, transformation, analysis, and synthesis of cartographic data in digital form.<br/> <br/></p><p><strong>Critical Data Visualization: History, Theory, and Practice</strong><br/> EVST 349, HIST 449J, HSHM 449, HUMS 446, URBN 382<br/> Bill Rankin</p><p>This class offers a critical analysis of data visualization, with an emphasis on the theory and politics of visual communication. In addition to examining historical data graphics from the late eighteenth century onward, students will study graphic semiology, ideals of objectivity and honesty, and recent developments in feminist and participatory data design. Technical tutorials in data visualization will be integrated into the course meetings, and optional support will be offered for advanced programming and mapping software. Prior software experience is not required.<br/> <br/></p><p><strong>Media Anxieties</strong><br/> FILM 438, FILM 766<br/> Neta Alexander and Francesco Casetti</p><p>This seminar delves into the multifaceted anxieties entwined with our always-connected lives. Drawing from diverse methodologies such as film history, German media theory, affect theory, critical data studies, gender studies, and disability studies, this seminar explores how black box technologies produce and sustain regimes of anxiety, fear and dependency. Topics include cinephilia/cinephobia, surveillance culture, algorithmic biases, addiction, and the politics of representation in digital spaces.<br/> <br/></p><p><strong>Time Machines: Reimagining the Past</strong><br/> HIST 181J<br/> John Gaddis</p><p>This seminar explores the concept of time machines, the ways they might be (or are) constructed, and how representations of the past can help us reimagine and “travel” to other times. Topics of discussion include the physics of time travel; some ways historians have used archives to reconstruct times past; the extent to which novelists complement, contradict, or complicate the work of historians; and the possibility of “animating” past visual representations, whether through art, film, or computer simulation. Students also will pursue individual projects using digitally available newspapers, focusing on a particular place in a particular year.<br/> <br/></p><p><strong>Art and Technology</strong><br/> HSAR 160<br/> Pamela Lee</p><p>This introductory course surveys the relationship between art and technology, from prehistoric cave art and rock art to the rise of NFTs. Drawing on a wide variety of artistic media, the class will explore topics such as the use of textiles as data storage before the advent of the computer; technologies for representing space in European and Asian painting, and the centrality of Arab science in developing linear perspective during the Renaissance; the cybernetic revolution and the rise of computers; biometrics and surveillance; and machine learning and art without artists. Sections may include visits to collections and sites across Yale’s campus.<br/> <br/></p><p><strong>Music and AI</strong><br/> MUS 645<br/> Ted Moore</p><p>This course introduces musicians to the concepts and implications of artificial intelligence (AI), with an emphasis on music generation tools. Students will examine how AI music systems work while considering the relationships between data, algorithms, and the humans that use them. In addition to analyzing music that uses AI, students will develop personally curated datasets and train AI models to experience how algorithms learn. No knowledge of programming is required.<br/> <br/></p><p><strong>The Philosophy of Cognitive Science and Artificial Intelligence</strong><br/> PHIL 740<br/> Laurie Paul and Tyler Brooke-Wilson</p><p>What is the structure of the mind? Can what we think influence what we see? Are people rational or irrational? This course looks at a number of such questions in the philosophy of cognitive science and AI, examining the space of possible minds described by AI, the major division of the mind into perception and cognition, and contemporary philosophical issues raised by recent developments in AI. Prior coursework in philosophy required.<br/> <br/></p><p><strong>YData: Measuring Culture</strong><br/> S&amp;DS 175, S&amp;DS 575, SOCY 163, SOCY 537<br/> Daniel Karell</p><p>This introductory course explores how data science can be used to measure the cultural landscape, trace the production and consumption of culture, and analyze the relationship between culture and a range of social phenomena. Students will review foundational and current theories and methodologies of computational approaches to studying culture, with an eye toward ultimately conducting their own social-scientific analyses.<br/> <br/></p><p><strong>Digital Technology and Politics</strong><br/> SOCY 250<br/> Yuan Hsiao</p><p>Digital technologies, or information and communication technologies (ICTs), have become crucial components of contemporary politics. This class uses core concepts of media sociology to explore a variety of political phenomena, such as digital-enabled protests, political influencers, hate and radical speech, the spread of misinformation, and more. Special emphasis will be placed the internet and social media.<br/> <br/></p><p><strong>Digital Humanities Practical Workshop Series</strong><br/> SPAN 984<br/> Alexander Gil Fuentes</p><p>Every term, the Department of Spanish and Portuguese and the Humanities Program offer practical DH workshops for graduate students.
